# **Scrit**  
**Splat:** Hob  
**Public Information:**  

Scrit is a **small, sniveling bird-goblin** with a knack for **survival through cowardice and quick thinking**. He has a **scrawny, vulture-like frame**, covered in **patchy, soot-streaked feathers**, with **beady black eyes that dart constantly** and a **sharp, hooked beak that never quite closes all the way**. His long, **clawed fingers twitch nervously**, and his **thin, ragged wings** are **too weak for proper flight**, making him more of a **ground-scuttling nuisance** than a true aerial predator.  

Scrit **survives by knowing things**—he listens, he watches, and he **grovels when needed**. He has a habit of **talking too fast, too much, and too nervously**, spilling information **before anyone even asks for it** if he thinks it'll save his own hide. While he lacks **true courage**, he does have a **keen sense of self-preservation**, and his **knowledge of the Hedge, its dangers, and its denizens** makes him a **valuable informant**—for the right price.  

Despite his **weaselly nature**, Scrit has **made a name for himself** among hobs and changelings alike as someone who can **dig up information**—as long as you’re willing to put up with **his rambling, his groveling, and his endless insistence that he is "just a poor, innocent Scrit who means no harm."**
