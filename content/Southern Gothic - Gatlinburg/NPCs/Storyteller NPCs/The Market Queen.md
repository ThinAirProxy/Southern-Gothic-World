# The Market Queen  
**Splat:** Hedge Denizen (Cursed Mortal)  
**Public Information:**  
The Market Queen is the youthful sovereign of the [[Goblin Market]]—an eternal child draped in silks and jewels, ruling from a throne of broken toys and golden spoils. Though she appears no older than eight, her eyes glint with the cunning of someone who has lived far longer in the twisted heart of the Hedge. It is said she was traded as a newborn and has grown up within the thorns, aging slowly and unnaturally. Her court is one of rules, riddles, and relentless barter. Every deal made in her domain binds by unspoken truths and smiling cruelty.

Those who visit her realm should come with gifts and caution. She is capricious, charming, and often dangerously bored. Though she is playful and fond of games, her power over the Market is absolute—and she never forgets a slight.
