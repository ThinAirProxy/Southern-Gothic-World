## ***Description:***  
### **Mask:**  
Bonny **moves like someone who has seen too much and has no patience for nonsense**. She dresses in **tight black jeans, old black t-shirts, and a worn-out blue jean jacket that has seen better days**. Her **heavy boots hit pavement hard**, every step deliberate, like she’s always walking **toward something inevitable**.  

She **never hurries, never hesitates**. Her eyes are **piercing and dark-rimmed**, making her **look permanently exhausted yet hyper-aware**. There’s something about her that makes people **nervous but unable to look away**. She smells faintly of **old fabric and earth, like rain hitting pavement after a long dry spell**. Her voice is **low, steady, the kind that makes you listen**. Some people think they **hear things when she speaks—tiny whispers beneath her words—but when they shake their heads, it’s gone**.  

### **Mien:**  
Bonny's body is **stitched together with silver thread**, faint **gossamer lines running along her limbs and torso**, as if she’s been **broken and rewoven a hundred times**. Beneath her skin, **spiders move**, their tiny legs pressing up against her flesh before **skittering away unseen**. Sometimes they **crawl from her sleeves and weave webs between her fingers**, only to disappear back into her body.  

Her **eyes catch the light strangely**, making them look **deep and layered, like a pit lined with golden silk**. When she stands still too long, her **shadow flickers, shifting unnaturally, as if something inside her is moving just beneath the surface**.

## ***Personality:***  
Bonny is **quiet, watchful, and deeply tired**. She **cares for people**, but she **doesn’t let them in too close**—not because she doesn’t want to, but because she **knows what they’ll see if they do**. She’s **gentle but unflinching**, her kindness **pragmatic, never sugarcoated**.  

She doesn’t expect **to belong anywhere**. She gave up on that long ago. Instead, she **wanders, stitching people back together**, never staying long enough for anyone to **ask too many questions**. She never raises her voice, never rushes, and never **reacts with surprise**—like she’s already seen **how everything plays out before it happens**.  

She fears the **spiders inside her**, even as she **loves them**. She saved them. She **promised them freedom**. But sometimes, when they **crawl under her skin**, she wonders if they whisper to her in a voice **that is not entirely her own**.

## ***Keeper:***  
**[[The Gnarled Old Crone]]** – An ancient, withered thing of **twisted roots and needle fingers**, a master of **unmaking and remaking**. She **kept Bonny as a pet, a prized spider**, adored for her ability to **mend the broken back together with silver threads**.  

## ***Seeming:***
