Hannah Grace Carter (neé Walker) is warm, charming, and effortlessly put together. Her hair is always styled, her lipstick never smudges, and she hosts the best damn charity bake sales in Gatlinburg. She’s the perfect wife to Archie Carter, the dedicated mother of two grown children, the kind of woman people admire, trust, and never question. No one remembers a time before she was like this—before she was polished, graceful, and exactly who she was supposed to be.

But she isn’t real.

Beneath the pearls and pastel dresses, behind the flawless smile, there’s something hollow. She never hesitates. Never forgets a name. Never feels out of place. She slides through conversations like a practiced act, says exactly what people want to hear, and never once wonders if she belongs.
