**Public Information:**
Noah Clark was born in March of 1976, just minutes before his twin sister, [[Peyton Woods]], in the heart of the Great Smoky Mountains. Raised in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, the twins grew up surrounded by misty ridges, winding trails, and the echoes of old Appalachian songs. Their childhood was steeped in tradition and folklore, shaped by a craftsman father and a park ranger mother who instilled in them a deep respect for the land and its stories.

From an early age, Peyton showed a natural talent for music, her fingers quick to learn the fiddle and guitar, her voice carrying the soul of old mountain ballads. But raw talent didn’t mean easy success. She struggled with the discipline it required, feeling trapped by the expectations placed on her. By the time she hit her teenage years, she rebelled hard—skipping school, sneaking out to party, and running with a crowd that cared little for the traditions she had grown up with. She wanted something different, something more than what felt like a prewritten script for her life.

Noah, always the quieter of the two, tried to ground her, but Peyton had to find her own way back. It wasn’t until she nearly lost everything—burning bridges, pushing away family, and realizing she was drifting with no real direction—that she finally stopped running. The music had never left her, and when she picked up her guitar again, it felt less like an obligation and more like a calling.

Noah followed a steadier path. He pursued his love of history and folklore, leaving briefly for university before returning home to work as a park guide and historian. His passion lay in preserving the stories of the land, ensuring that the myths, legends, and histories of the Smokies were never forgotten.

Despite their different journeys, the twins remained close. Their bond, tested but unbroken, was always rekindled over long hikes through the mountains or evenings on the porch at their family home.
