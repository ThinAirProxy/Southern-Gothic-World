**Public Information:**

James Garza Rodríguez is a man who got a second chance. A decade ago, he went missing - slipped away in the night, leaving behind family and friends who never stopped looking. And then, miraculously, he returned. It took time for them to trust him again. There were rough patches, nights spent reassuring everyone that yes, really, he was fine. 

Eventually, things settled. 

He has a life now, one he rebuilt carefully from the ashes of his youth. He wakes up early to make breakfast for Paul, listens to Kristy's latest work drama over the phone, and spends his shifts at the hospital making sure people wake up from their surgeries safely.  

Outside of work, he volunteers at a local clinic, helps run community health workshops, and plays in a casual soccer league on weekends. There was a time when he worried he wasn't enough, that no matter how much he gave, but those fears are long gone. He's earned a good life. After all, he's good at what he does. He's good at being a husband, a brother, a friend. 

Maybe he isn't exactly like how they remember, but people change. Trauma does strange things to a person. He's a little quieter now, a little softer. He doesn't mind letting bygones be bygones.

And if, once in a while, he feels the weight of something watching from the edges of his world - he ignores it.

He doesn't like to dwell on the past.
