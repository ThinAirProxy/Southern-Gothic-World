# Virginia Kleine
**Splat:** #Fetch 
**Public Information:** No one had much to say about Virginia, when she was growing up. Anyone that knew of her at all knew her as **David's sister** or **that one girl I see in class sometimes**, or similar, impersonal phrases. David himself had little to say about her. It seemed the middle Kleine child was a blank space in the lives of everyone that should have known her. 

Regardless, there were more interesting people in the Kleine family to discuss. Another resounding success for David, more news about Rachel, David's sickly youngest sister. Their father, Matthew was away on military service, and Mary Ann, their mother, was far too busy worrying over Rachel or celebrating David to spend much time worrying about Virginia. 

And it stayed that way, with Virginia Kleine being a ghost haunting the halls of her house, all the way up until she left for college. **But something was different** when she came back. Gone was the girl that drifted unseen through her own life, replaced by someone who **demanded** attention. She was **charismatic, driven**, and wasn't afraid to be the **center of attention**. And everyone else? They couldn't have been more pleased.

In the **Thirty-five** years since Virginia returned from college, she became one of Gatlinburg's most shining and exemplary citizens. She is now one of the city's top attorney's and her profession has made her a commanding force, fierce yet able to charm just about anyone. She has since been married to **Ruby Calloway**, and when her father and mother moved to rural Georgia, and her brother left for greener pastures, Virginia chose to remain in Gatlinburg with her now wife and the life she had built. 

But the truth of the matter was, that it wasn't Virginia that came back home in 1990. It was a being of glass shards and gemstones. And now that the real Virginia Kleine is back in Gatlinburg, that being knows what it is. And it isn't ready to give up the life it built.
