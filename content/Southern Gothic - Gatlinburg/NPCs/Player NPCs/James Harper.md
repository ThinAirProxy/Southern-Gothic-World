### **Public Information:**  
James "Jim" Harper is the gruff yet dependable owner of **Whispering Winds Farm**, a small but well-respected nursery and produce farm on the outskirts of Gatlinburg. Born and raised in the Tennessee mountains, Jim has spent his entire life working the land, watching the seasons change, and learning the rhythms of the earth. Now in his late sixties, he carries the weight of a lifetime of labor—his hands are calloused, his back is bent from years of fieldwork, and the deep lines in his face tell the story of a man who has spent more time under the sun than under a roof.  

Jim is a man of few words, preferring action over conversation. He doesn't sugarcoat things, doesn’t waste time on pleasantries, and expects hard work from those who sign on to help. To him, honesty and work ethic mean more than charm or empty promises. He doesn’t put up with laziness or dishonesty, but he pays his workers on time, and if you prove yourself, he’ll go out of his way to make sure you’ve got what you need. Those who’ve worked for him long enough know that a rare nod of approval or a simple "Good work" from Jim is worth more than any flowery praise.  

Lately, though, something’s been nagging at him. The fields are thriving more than usual. Crops are coming in healthier, flowers blooming just a little too brightly. He’s seen good seasons before, but this feels different. The new girl, **Rose**, swore up and down she knew how to handle plants, and damn if she hasn’t backed it up. But there’s something else about her. The way she watches the fields like they’re whispering to her, the way the plants almost seem to shift under her hands. He doesn’t believe in ghosts or magic, but **he knows the land, and something about this girl is making the farm hum in a way he can’t explain.**  

Jim isn’t the kind of man to ask too many questions. If **Rose** wants work and she’s willing to put in the effort, he’ll keep her on. And if she’s making his land prosper? Well, maybe it’s best not to poke at things that are better left alone.
