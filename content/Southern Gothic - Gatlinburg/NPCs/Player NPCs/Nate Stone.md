# **Nathaniel "Nate" Stone**

***Splat:*** #Mortal
***Public Information:*** Nathaniel Stone is **a lifelong Gatlinburg local**, a man who once **laughed easily, fought fiercely, and never let anyone he loved slip through his fingers—until one did**. A former **park ranger turned volunteer firefighter**, Nate has spent **the last twenty years carrying the weight of an absence he never learned to fill**.  

After his sister vanished without a trace, he became **a man of unfinished sentences and unanswered questions**. He never truly gave up looking, even when **the years piled up and people told him to move on**. He still **carries her memory**, still **visits the places they once called home**, and still **wonders if he missed something—if he could have done more**.  

Now, **Abigail is back, or at least, something that looks like her is**. She is a **doctor, a success, everything she always wanted to be**—but Nate can’t shake the feeling that **she is not his sister**. And somewhere in the city’s shadows, **something else watches him, hesitating, wanting, afraid to step forward**.
