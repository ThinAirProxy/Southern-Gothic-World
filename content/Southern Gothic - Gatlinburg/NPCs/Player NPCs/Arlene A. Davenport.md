**Public Information:** As a recent arrival from out-of-town, along with so many trickling in as the winter season thaws, Arlene Davenport would not be well-known in local circles. What is known is that her ambitions to expand Davenport Windows and Doors across state lines to Tennessee are moving rapidly, with ground already broken on a new warehouse and service center outside of Pigeon Forge. Local radio and television already buzzes with advertisements, replete with a catchy jingle set to the pluck of guitar strings.

No gimmicks, no games
You can trust the name, Davenport
You can trust to come home to Davenport~*

Anyone doing further research would come across a picture-perfect curated social media feed detailing work done in the Shenandoah Valley and New River Valley of Virginia. Arlene's bright smile and striking sharp looks would be seen in reference to work done for non-profits like Habitat for Humanity and the Salvation Army. There are also frequent images of Arlene with her silver-haired but active parents silhouetted against various local landmarks like Natural Bridge and the entrance to Grand Caverns.

Glenn and Ellen Davenport, for their part, seem to be less into the public show but are happy that their daughter has found her place after the traumatic unpleasantness of a while back. If they privately worry that her only purpose seems to be to promote them and see to their needs, if she is just a bit too much the *perfect* sinless daughter they thought they wanted, they keep such worries to themselves. It would be ungrateful to look such a blessed gift horse in the mouth.

When she abruptly announced her decision to take some vacation time amidst a more passive role promoting their new location in Sevier County, the elder Davenports were quietly relieved. Whatever had drawn her first to Roanoke, and then to Sevier County, seemed to have put new fire in her or at least given her goals besides tending to them.

Anyone able to see through the Mask would see a quite different face in those social media feeds. Pinewood, charred and smoking eternally from a forest fire that never extinguishes, bound by ligaments of parchment and crowned with shredded strips of a formal contract in lieu of hair, "Arlene Alexandra Davenport" is the creation of the Devil at the Crossroads. She knows what she is and knows her purpose: her master has decreed that for the sinners who signed on the dotted line, there is no escape and can never be. Only time will tell if she can grow beyond this or whether her existence is summed up as another lash in the Devil's hand.

You can trust the name, Davenport
You can trust to come home... to Davenport~*
