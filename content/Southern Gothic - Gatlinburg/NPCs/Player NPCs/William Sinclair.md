# Mayor William Sinclair

***Splat:*** #Mortal 
***Public Information:*** William Sinclair is the long-standing mayor of Gatlinburg, a man who has built his career on control, stability, and the weight of his name. Respected, calculating, and always two steps ahead, he has weathered scandals, outmaneuvered rivals, and ensured that Gatlinburg remains his city.

But **twenty-five years ago**, something slipped through his fingers when **his daughter vanished without a trace**. He did what was expected: the press conferences, the search efforts, the carefully managed grief. And when the city moved on, so did he.

**Now she's back**. Or something that looks like her, because impossibly she's hardly aged a day. When he sees her, she is still 23, still **exactly as she was in 1999**, frozen in time while the rest of the world moved on.

Bill Sinclair is not a man who believes in ghosts. But when he sees her, he turns and walks the other way. Because if he doesn’t acknowledge her, **maybe she won’t be real.**
