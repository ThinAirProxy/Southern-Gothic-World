#  **Dr. Abigail Stone** 

***Splat:*** #Fetch   
***Public Information:*** Dr. Abigail Stone is a **well-respected cosmetic surgeon in Gatlinburg**, known for her **steady hands, meticulous work, and cold professionalism**. She runs a **high-end private clinic**, catering to **the wealthy and the vain**, sculpting their faces into whatever perfection they desire.  

She is **poised, elegant, and utterly unshakable**, with a **brilliant smile and a practiced warmth** that never quite reaches her eyes. While many admire her **skill and success**, those who spend enough time around her may notice something **unsettling**—a sense that she **never truly blinks, never really breathes**, and that her **expressions feel just a little too rehearsed**.  

What she doesn’t know—**what she can’t know**—is that she is an **imposter**, a **shadow given shape**. Somewhere in the world, **the woman she was made to replace has returned**, and though she does not believe in ghosts… **something in her bones tells her she is being watched.**
