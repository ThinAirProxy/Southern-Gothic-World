# The Glassheart Garden
*Accessible through Room 14 at the [[The Hollow Inn]].*

***Owner:*** [[Rose Thorne]]
***Location:*** The Hedge (Personal Hollow)

***Description:***
Hidden beyond a wardrobe door lies a long-forgotten **greenhouse**, swallowed by the Hedge and slowly repurposed into a sanctuary of soft light and heavy memory. Ivy wraps around the rusting steel beams, and cracked panes of glass filter in the Hedge’s muted twilight, refracting it into soft pools of shifting color.

Inside, **hammocks are strung between supports**, nestled in corners draped with flowering vines. Wild roses, morning glories, and unseen blossoms bloom in shades not found in the mortal world. The air is warm and sweet, humid with the scent of longing, and always carries the soft hush of rain that never seems to fall. It's a place to rest, to breathe, to remember—and to want.


### **Notable Features:**

- **Size Matters (•):** The greenhouse is spacious enough for Rose and several others to relax, dream, or gather. The air encourages quiet conversation, confession, and calm. A place made for the heart, not the sword.

- **Escape Route (•):** A back door, nearly hidden behind a wall of honeysuckle, opens into a **seldom-used supply closet of a gas station** several miles away from the Hollow Inn. It’s dusty, remote, and perfect for slipping away unnoticed.

- **Phantom Phone Booth (•):** At the center of the garden stands a **large stone bath**, filled with still, dark water. When used, the surface ripples gently, revealing the face of whoever Rose is contacting—like a reflection stolen from time. Occasionally, it shows someone she didn’t mean to reach.
