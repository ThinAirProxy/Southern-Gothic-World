### **[[The Valley of Stars]]**  
*"The darkness has weight. The light moves in shapes not meant for mortal eyes."*  

The **Valley of Stars** is **a place where the world drops away**, a valley so **deep and vast that no light from above ever reaches its floor**. The only illumination comes from **the creatures that dwell in its depths**, bioluminescent and strange, casting **ghostly lights in the eternal dark**.  

To look down into the valley is **to feel like you are standing at the edge of the sky**, staring into **a reflection of the night, but twisted, wrong, infinite in ways the mind cannot process**. Those who descend must **navigate by the shifting constellations of the living things below**, lest they fall into the depths **where no one has ever returned from**.  

- **Dangers:** The **Echoing Hunger**, a thing that **lives in the deepest parts of the valley**, swallowing light, sound, and memory.  
- **Rewards:** **Secrets lost to time**, buried in the dark where **even the Gentry do not reach**.  
- **Paths:** The deeper you go, the **more you forget the sky**, the harder it is to **remember if you were ever meant to leave**.
