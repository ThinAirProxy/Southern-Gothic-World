### **[[The Caves of Bones]]**  
*"The walls remember. Every step is a history written in dust and marrow."*  

Beneath the mountains, **deep below the Hedge, the caves twist endlessly**, their **walls lined with the bones of creatures that have died in these hills**. Some are **ancient**, brittle and **fused into the rock itself**. Others are **fresh**, the marrow still lingering.  

The tunnels are **silent, save for the distant, rhythmic sound of dripping water**, a sound that some claim is **not water at all, but something deeper, something waiting**. The bones **hold memories**, and those who can listen **may learn the truths buried in the dark**. But **disturb the dead too much, and the caves will remember you, too**.  

- **Dangers:** The **Whispering Remains**, bones that still **speak, move, and call to those who pass through**.  
- **Rewards:** **Knowledge of the past**, waiting to be **plucked from the marrow of the dead**.  
- **Paths:** The deeper you go, the **more the walls shift, sealing behind you, leading you toward places best left undisturbed**.
