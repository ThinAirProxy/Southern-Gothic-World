### **The Local Hedge, [[The Forgotten Hills]]** 
*"The mountains remember. The roots twist deep. The paths wind ever onward, leading the Lost astray."*  

The **Hedge of Appalachia** is **ancient, hungry, and wild**. It does not follow the **logic of mortals** or the **twisted glamour of Arcadia**, but rather the **memory of the land itself**. It is a reflection of **Appalachia’s oldest fears and deepest wonders**, a place where **forgotten spirits whisper in the trees**, where the **echoes of the past are woven into every root and stone**.  

This is not a **place of gentle brambles and tangled paths**—this is the Hedge of the **mountains, of lost folk songs, of haints and hollers where nothing stays buried for long**. It is **vast**, stretching beyond **Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge**, linking into the **great, unseen corridors of the Hedge that touch all of Appalachia**. For those who dare to travel its trods, it offers **both bounty and doom**.
