# The Goblin Market

***Owner:*** The Market Queen  
***Location:*** Deep within the Hedge, accessible only through shifting trods or entering through the  [[Pigeon Forge Outlet Mall]].

***Description:***  
The Goblin Market is a sprawling, ever-changing place of twisted wonder, hidden deep within the Hedge and built atop the ruins of forgotten bargains. It takes the form of a surreal and fantastical version of a modern American shopping mall—complete with cracked tile floors, spiraling escalators made of living wood, and flickering neon signage that hums with barely-contained glamour. The ceiling arches high above in impossible curves of ivy and bone, and the air smells of roasted hedgefruit, old coins, and ink.  

Stalls and storefronts are run by hobs of every shape and size, peddling wares both mundane and impossible: jars filled with stolen memories, gloves that lie for you, music boxes that sing your name in reverse, and cursed candy that tastes like nostalgia. No one pays in money. Everything is bought and sold in **secrets, favors, names, dreams, and stories**. Shoppers drift through the market like fish in a current—some lost, some hungry, some just trying to survive.  

The Market is ruled with velvet authority by **[[The Market Queen]]**, a childlike sovereign of immense cunning and cruel playfulness. Her rules are absolute, and her Knight, **[[Sir Bramblegut]]**, ensures they are upheld. Every deal made here is binding—every promise has weight. Enter at your own risk, and never forget: the Market gives nothing for free.
