### **[[The Smokey Mountain]]**  
*"The smoke rolls in like a tide, thick and endless. The higher you climb, the less you can see."*  

The **Smokey Mountain** is **tall, silent, and veiled in an endless rolling fog**. It is **not snow that covers its peaks, but smoke**, so **thick and heavy that even sound struggles to pass through it**. Those who try to **climb to the summit** often find themselves **turned around, descending the same paths they swore they had just climbed**.  

This is a place of **lost things**, where **the echoes of those who failed to escape the Gentry linger**. The smoke is **alive, shifting and whispering**, sometimes forming **figures that feel almost familiar**. Some say the mountain is **watching**, choosing who is allowed to reach its peak and who is meant to wander forever.  

- **Dangers:** The **Hollow Men**, figures that **lurk in the fog, their faces missing, their voices stolen**.  
- **Rewards:** **Safe paths through the Hedge**, known only to those **who can read the smoke**.  
- **Paths:** The **higher you climb, the harder it is to breathe, to think, to remember**â€”the mountain does not let go easily.
