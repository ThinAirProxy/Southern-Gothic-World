# Quarter House Arcade  

***Owner:*** Unclaimed (but a known haunt of the Lost)  
***Location:*** Downtown Gatlinburg  

***Description:***  
Bright neon **buzzes softly in the dim glow of CRT screens**, casting shifting colors across the faces of those lost in the games. The scent of **old carpet, hot pizza, and sugar-sweet soda** lingers in the air, mingling with the sound of **button mashing and muffled laughter**.  

Quarter House Arcade is a **relic of a different time**, a place where the past clings **stubbornly** to the present. The walls are lined with **classic cabinets—Pac-Man, Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter—some of them running smoother than they have any right to**. In the back, **a lounge area** offers cracked leather couches, dimly lit corners, and an **unspoken rule that what’s said here stays here**.  

For the Lost, **Quarter House is more than a hangout—it’s neutral ground**. A place to **mingle without politics, to trade favors over rounds of pinball, or to meet contacts without the watchful eyes of the Freehold’s power players**.  

Some say that **certain machines don’t just play games**. That if you find the right one, **punch in the right high score, press the right buttons at the right time**, you might just find yourself **somewhere else entirely**. But where, exactly, depends on the game you play.
