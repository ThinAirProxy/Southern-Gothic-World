# The Hall of Mirrors  

***Owner:*** Unclaimed  
***Location:*** Tourist District, Gatlinburg  

***Description:***  
By day, The Hall of Mirrors is just another tourist attraction, a dazzling maze of reflections where visitors laugh as they stumble through its twisting corridors of glass. It is a place of **smoke and illusion**, a harmless trick of the light—**for most**.  

But for the Lost, it is something more.  

Step into the maze at **the right time, with the right heart**, and the mirrors do not just reflect—they **swallow**. The glass ripples like water, and instead of a dead-end, a path appears. Those who **know the way** can pass through, slipping between reflections, stepping into something **far older, far stranger, far more dangerous**.  

Beyond the illusion of the mundane, The Hall of Mirrors is a **gateway to the Hedge**, opening into the **Forest of Gold and Flames**. There, deep within the burning woods, lies the **true Hall of Mirrors**—a **vast and opulent castle**, its mirrored walls rising like frozen light, catching and distorting the flickering firelight from the golden leaves.  

Inside, the air is **thick with Glamour**, the scent of old enchantments lingering on the glass. The halls shift endlessly, twisting into **reflections of places long forgotten**. To gaze too long into its walls is to risk **losing yourself to another version of your story**, one that may have never been.  

Few who venture in **leave unchanged**, and even fewer ever find the **true heart** of the castle. Some say that at the center of the **ever-shifting halls**, a secret waits—a place where the mirrors do not just reflect, but **reveal**.
