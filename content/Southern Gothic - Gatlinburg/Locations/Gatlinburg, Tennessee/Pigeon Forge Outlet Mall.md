# Pigeon Forge Factory Outlet Mall  

***Owner:*** Multiple Ironside businesses, but something else runs the Hedgewise side  
***Location:*** Pigeon Forge, just off the main strip  

***Description:***  
A sprawling **labyrinth of discount stores, kitschy souvenir shops, and overpriced tourist bait**, the **Pigeon Forge Factory Outlet Mall** is a place where **money moves fast and people move faster**. Bright fluorescent lights **buzz overhead**, and the air is filled with **the scent of cheap candles, food court grease, and the ever-present hum of conversations blending into white noise**.  

For most, it’s just another **tourist trap**, a place to grab **novelty shirts, knockoff handbags, or bulk candy at ridiculous markups**. But for the Lost, there’s **more beneath the surface**.  

Find the right store. **Step through the wrong dressing room mirror, walk past the "Employees Only" sign when no one is looking, or follow the scent of something that doesn’t belong.** On the other side, past the thin film of reality, lies the **Goblin Market of Pigeon Forge**, a **chaotic, thriving bazaar of the Hedge**, hidden in the **bones of a shopping mall that never quite closes**.  

Here, the neon lights are **warmer**, flickering with **otherworldly energy**, and the stalls sell **things that should not be bought, bargains that should not be made**. The merchants are **hobs, Changelings, and things that have never worn human skin**, offering **deals on everything from Hedge fruit and spun dreams to names long forgotten and memories never lived**.  

The market **shifts every night**, its **entrance never in the same place twice**. Some Lost come to **trade, to deal, to risk it all for something rare**. Others come because they have no choice—because sometimes, **the Goblin Market calls to those who have a debt to pay.**
