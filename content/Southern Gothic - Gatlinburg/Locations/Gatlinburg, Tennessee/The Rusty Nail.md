# The Rusty Nail  

***Owner:*** Big Charlie (Mortal, doesn’t ask questions)  
***Location:*** Just off the highway, on the outskirts of Gatlinburg  

***Description:***  
The **lights are low, the smoke is thick**, and the jukebox in the corner plays **songs older than most of the patrons**. The air **smells of cheap beer, old leather, and cigarette ash**, and the sound of **pool balls cracking against each other** echoes over the low murmur of conversation.  

The Rusty Nail is **the kind of place that doesn’t welcome tourists**, a hole-in-the-wall bar where **outsiders are noticed, but rarely acknowledged**. The regulars are mostly **bikers, truckers, and the kind of people who don’t take well to questions**. But for the Lost, **it’s a sanctuary of a different kind**—one of the few Ironside places where a Changeling can disappear into the background, drink without worrying about politics, and maybe **win a few favors in a game of eight-ball**.  

The bartender, **Big Charlie**, is **built like a brick wall and talks like he’s allergic to small talk**. He doesn’t ask **what you are**, only **what you’re drinking**, and as long as you don’t bring **trouble to his bar**, he doesn’t much care what you are either.  

If you need a place to **lay low, make a quiet deal, or settle something with a fistfight instead of words**, The Rusty Nail is **always open**. Just **don’t spill blood on the felt**, and **don’t ask what’s in the special**.
