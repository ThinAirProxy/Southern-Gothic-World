# Sir Bramblegut
**Splat:** Hob (Knight of the [[Goblin Market]])  
### Public Information:

Sir Bramblegut is the towering, grim-faced Knight Commander of [[The Market Queen]]’s court. Nearly eighteen feet tall and composed of bark, bone, rusted iron, and winding thorn-vines, he serves as both her enforcer and her herald. His head is the skull of a stag, crowned with antlers strung with bones and charms that clatter when he moves. Though monstrous in form, he speaks with cold, formal precision and never raises his voice. He is often the first—and last—face one sees when dealing with the Queen. 

He is known to enforce the laws of the Goblin Market with exacting brutality, though he never breaks the rules himself. Anyone wishing to trade with Her Sweetness must first speak to Bramblegut and offer something of worth. He takes his duties seriously, and though he is rarely cruel without cause, few forget the feeling of being watched through the hollow sockets of his skull.
