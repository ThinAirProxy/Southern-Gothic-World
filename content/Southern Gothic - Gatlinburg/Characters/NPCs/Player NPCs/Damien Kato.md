### **Public Information:**
Damien Kato had always been the weird kid—the one who skipped class to smoke weed behind the gym, who liked niche films and anti-social music, and who was sharp enough to coast when he had to by but too restless to care. He had no plans, no drive, just a lingering sense that the world had nothing worth his effort. Then, after graduation, he vanished for a few months. When he returned, he was different. Gone was the listless burnout; in his place stood a young man with focus, ambition—the son his parents had always wanted.

Fast forward to now, and Damien Kato is just shy of 50, is a happily married tech industry whiz, successful, well-adjusted, and thriving. But what he doesn’t know—what perhaps no one around him suspects—is that he’s made of nothing more than dark ichor and twigs, a mockery of a man built to fit a stolen life. And somewhere in town, the real Damien Kato is watching, seething, waiting for the moment to take back what was his.
