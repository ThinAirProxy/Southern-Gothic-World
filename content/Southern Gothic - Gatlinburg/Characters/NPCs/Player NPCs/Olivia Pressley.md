# **Olivia Pressley**  
**Splat:** #Fetch   

### Public Information:  

**Olivia Pressley** has spent the last several weeks in a coma, a tragic remnant of the failed suicide pact that claimed **Noah Dunn’s** life. Found unresponsive on Christmas Eve, she was rushed to the hospital, where doctors struggled to understand why she survived while **Noah** did not. The poison should have killed her—but instead, she lingers, caught somewhere between life and death.  

Her family, convinced that this is their **Olivia**, keeps vigil at her bedside, posting updates online, holding out hope that she will wake up. The town speaks of the tragedy in hushed tones, another dark mark on the long feud between the **[[Jim & Carrie Pressley|Pressley]]** and **Dunn** families.  

But **Olivia Pressley** is not truly their daughter—**she is a Fetch, woven from living thorns and bound around a brass skeleton, a perfect mimicry of the girl who should have died that night.** Beneath the illusion of human skin, roses bloom from her ribs, and vines coil beneath her bones. Since **[[Rose Thorne|Rose]]** escaped Arcadia, **Olivia has started to stir**—small movements, faint whispers in her sleep.  

One day, **she will wake up**. When she does, **what will she remember? Will she believe she is the real Olivia, or will she sense the truth—that something else is walking around with her face?** And more importantly, **what will she do about it?**
