### Public Information:  

Kristy Garza Rodríguez knows how to pick her battles. When her brother first vanished, she chased every dead end like she was a rabid dog, begging the universe to give him back. And when it did - when he walked through the door, different but home - she made a choice. She let him stay.

Sure, there were doubts in the beginning, but she'd already lost him once. If something about him had changed, well... wasn't that to be expected? People aren't statues. They aren't preserved in amber. Despite whatever he'd been through, he knew things only *[[James Garza Rodriguez|James]]* could know. He supported her the way only *James* could.

Since then, she’s spent most of the last decade putting herself exactly where she wants to be - at the top of her field, a lead data analyst at a growing firm with a solid reputation. She's good at her job, and she's built a team that respects her. Work keeps her busy, but outside of that, she's been finding time for herself. She’s traveling more, taking weekend trips to new cities, trying new things just because she can.

James is doing well, too. He finally settled down with the "best friend" he'd been mooning over for decades. She can stop worrying about them at last.

If there's a little distance there, if she doesn’t call as often as she used to, it's not because anything's wrong. It's just life.
