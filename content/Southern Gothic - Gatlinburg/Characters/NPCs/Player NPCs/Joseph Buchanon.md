# Joseph "Joe" Buchanon
**Splat:** #Mortal   

### Public Information:  
Joseph is an even-tempered, hardworking musician. He can often be found busking with his banjo along the Gatlinburg strip. Hushed whispers used to envelop his life after his husband was diagnosed with cancer and set out to find alternative treatments when chemotherapy was no longer working.

To his and the town's surprise, Bill came back after only a few short months away - totally cured! Joseph has chalked up the strange behaviors and newfound desires to a renewed interest in life after a successful miracle brought Bill back from the brink.

Joe, ever accommodating, is spending more time at home lately with his returned husband in their mountain cabin about 10 minute's drive outside of town.
