### Public Information:  

Harold Falconer was born and raised in Murfreesboro, Tennessee as any native Gatlinburger can decipher from the cadence of his thick drawl alone. He graduated from UTK in the spring of 2013, and worked on his family's farm for some time after.

In 2017, Harry bought land on a mountainside overlooking the neon-doused strip of Gatlinburg, a view he claimed was adored by his late wife â€“ and that was where he erected a cabin after her passing, and where he and Joe moved into in late 2020. He and his husband, Joseph Buchanon, became staple residents at the summer farmer's markets and a steady stall in the Pigeon Forge Factory Outlet Mall.

Harry and Joe lived peacefully for several years in their wooden retreat, until Harold received a harrowing cancer diagnosis. After over a year of medications, therapies, and consultation after consultation with no good news, Harry packed up and set out on a westward roadtrip to seek new answers, alternative options, and experimental treatments.

After returning to Gatlinburg barely three months after setting out to find treatment for his cancer, Harold William Falconer has changed. Friends and neighbors alike urge Bill to return to his pre-roadtrip sociability, but he politely refuses them as he waves a goodbye to head back up the mountain. From his newly found homebody demeanor to the insistence that he take his husband's surname and a fresh nickname, Bill is a sight for sore eyes when he does decide to haul some of his homegrown veggies into town.
