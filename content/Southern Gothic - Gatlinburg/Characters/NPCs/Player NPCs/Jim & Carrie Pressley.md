# **Jim & Carrie Pressley**  
**Splat:** #Mortal   

## **Public Information:**  
Jim and Carrie Pressley have spent their entire lives in **Gatlinburg**, their names familiar in town even to those who don’t know them personally. 

**Jim** was the golden boy of his high school years—star quarterback, hometown hero—who never quite let go of those days. He still talks about **"the big game"** like it happened yesterday, reliving the highlights for anyone who’ll listen. Now, he works as an **assistant manager at an auto parts store**, coaching the local pee-wee football team and drinking just a little too much when the memories get too heavy.  

**Carrie**, on the other hand, was the bookish valedictorian—the nerdy girl who somehow ended up with the town’s most popular boy. She’s **sharp-witted, pragmatic, and stubborn**, a woman who speaks her mind and always has a plan. She’s worked as a **librarian at the elementary school for over twenty years**, and there isn’t a single kid in town she hasn’t helped find the perfect book. When tragedy struck their family, she **didn’t break, but she hardened**, throwing herself into work, into community projects, into anything that kept her moving forward.  

Their daughter, **[[Olivia Pressley]], fell into a coma on Christmas Eve** after what was ruled a **failed suicide attempt.** They don’t talk about it in public—the **gossip is unbearable**—but at home, it lingers in the air like smoke. **Jim avoids it, Carrie confronts it, and neither of them truly knows what to do.**  

Jim sits by Olivia’s bedside in the hospital and tells her stories, **pretending she’s still that little girl who cheered with him** from the stands at the local high school football games. Carrie reads to her from old books, her voice never wavering, her **fingertips tight against Olivia’s cold hand.**  

What they don’t know is **the girl in that hospital bed isn’t Olivia at all.** Their daughter escaped Arcadia weeks ago, wearing a different name, walking the same streets **as a stranger to her own family.** And the Fetch—the thing that took her place—**is slowly starting to wake up.**
