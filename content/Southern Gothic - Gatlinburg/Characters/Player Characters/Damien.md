> *Once was a boy, soft and slow,*
*The Crone took his bones and bade him grow.*
*She boiled his shape, she burned his name,*
*And when he stepped out, he wasn't the same.*
*But the boy was patient, the boy was sly,*
*He learned her words, he watched her lie.*
*Now free at last, with fire instead,*
*He'll come back one night—to take her head.*

***Description:***  
**Mask:** Damien’s mortal guise carries echoes of what lurks beneath. He’s tall and lean, his dark hair forever tousled, never quite under control. Tattoos sprawl across his skin like something alive, creeping up his arms and curling along his neck, their edges blurred as if they’ve been there longer than they should. He smells like an old band shirt forgotten at the back of a drawer—faintly musty, well-worn, steeped in memories—with the lingering trace of cigarette smoke. His wardrobe is a reflection of that scent: threadbare tees, faded hoodies, and denim softened by time, as if he’s always dressed in remnants of a life already slipping away.

**Mien:** The Darkling looks like a man pulled from the depths of a forgotten bog, something that should have stayed beneath the surface. His black hair drinks the light, shifting and floating as if still submerged. Veins of inky ichor pulse beneath his pallid, waterlogged skin, twisting and spreading like spilled ink on fragile parchment. His eyes are fathomless pools, their darkness devouring the whites entirely when Glamour stirs within him. A ghostly mist clings to him, curling at his feet and shoulders, the scent of damp earth and decay laced with the brittle musk of old books and the acrid bite of something brewed in a witch’s cauldron. He is a walking, breathing bog—cold, endless, and hungry.

***Personality:***
Damien moves through the world with a quiet, deliberate presence—calm on the surface, but driven by a relentless hunger for understanding. He is patient, observant, and methodical, his easy-going demeanour belying the razor-sharp focus that ignites when faced with the unknown. The pursuit of lost knowledge, of secrets buried in ink and whispers, is not just an obsession but a weapon he sharpens against the Gentry. His voice carries a flat, measured cadence, often unreadable, but his expressions betray him—sharp glances, the quirk of a brow, the slight narrowing of his eyes when something piques his interest and curl of his lip when he’s amused. He can be pedantic, meticulous in dissecting details others might overlook, but there’s a certain satisfaction in it—whether he’s unraveling an obscure pledge or quietly picking apart the flaws in someone else’s reasoning.

> **Seven of Wands:** Damien's very existence is a quiet defiance, a subtle rebellion against the rules and whims of the Gentry. He bides his time, learning their ways, understanding their intricacies, but beneath the surface, his every move is laced with the knowledge that one day, he will be their foil. He is not their servant; he is a thorn in their side, a reminder that not all of their creations bend to their will. In the dark corners of his mind, he crafts plans, ever patient, knowing that when the time comes, he will not just escape their grasp—he will make them feel the weight of their own cruelty, using their own arrogance against them.

***Keeper:*** [[The Gnarled Old Crone]]

***Kith:*** Sideromancer (The One Who Sees) | Notary (The One Who Understands)  

***Court:*** [[The Court of Wands]]  
***Mantle:*** Depths Seer (••)  
It is not enough to glimpse the fire flickering on the horizon. True sight demands more - the courage to look beneath still waters, into the places others will not go. In the silent dark where pressure crushes and light forgets, something waits. It watches back. It remembers. Still watching for fires, Damien now digs deeper, risking more to get the answers the Freehold needs.
>

## ***Those with a shared Keeper may remember:***

**Seven of Pentacles:** Damien played the part of the dutiful apprentice well—too well. He stirred the Crone’s cauldron without question, traced the intricate lines of her sigils with careful fingers, and whispered the forgotten words she fed him. But his dark eyes never lost their edge, never dulled into the blank, obedient stare of those truly lost to her work. He listened, he learned, and he waited. To the Crone, he was another raw thing being shaped by her hand—but Damien had no intention of staying unfinished.

**Seven of Swords:** Damien moved through the Hollowed Bog like a shadow, obedient hands stirring, inscribing, binding—but whenever the Crone turned away, his eyes burned with a smoldering, unrelenting fury. He watched her with the quiet intensity of something caged, something sharpening its claws behind a mask of servitude. His gaze traced every movement, every word, not with reverence, but with calculation, hate simmering beneath his waterlogged skin. In the flickering light of the cauldron, his glower was a promise—one day, fortune will flip.

## Roleplay Hooks:
> The following may not be known IC, but can be used to help determine what our characters have in common or for setting a scene.

**Alright, next:** Damien holds many jobs and many hats. One day he's operating a Ferris wheel, a week later you may see him at the front desk of the Ripley's museum. Tourism work is seasonal, and they thankfully ask few questions about where you came from. The Skylift seems to be the only consistent place he ends up.

**Third-Eye:** Damien's clever when it comes to pledges and just all around weird shit, and has a good eye for looking at things if you get stuck - he even tries to piece together Gentry logic to use against them and is an expert in Fairytales, Tarot and most things occult. He's a divination whiz and has more refined Kenning depite the debt that mounts up.

**Toil and Trouble:** While his powers are still manifesting and growing stronger every day, Damien stole some of the Crone's tricks after being under her thumb for a few decades. He maintains a presence in the Goblin Market every now and then, trying to ease down his debt, and can easily be lured in with 'weird shit' and promise of interesting wares.

**Stuck In The '90s:** Damien was taken in the mid 90s, has opinions on what he's found out about the world he missed along the way and dated references. Those who understand them are perfect company, and those who want to know 'what it was like' are free to pepper him with questions.

**The Omen:** Damien was a weird kid, and his name also didn't help during the Satanic Panic era. He was picked on and an outcast, not helped by his antisocial albeit chill behaviour and interests like classic monster films and dense fantasy books. That may be cool now, but it wasn't then. Funny now that Damien can perform actual divination.
