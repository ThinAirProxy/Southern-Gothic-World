***Description:***  
***Mask***: Paega is a young woman with an air of quiet intensity. Her long, dark brown hair flows over her shoulders in natural waves, often falling into her face in an effortlessly tousled way. High cheekbones, a straight nose, and full lips give her a sharp, well-defined look, while her fair skin contrasts with the dark aesthetic she embraces. Her deep-set eyes, accentuated by bold winged eyeliner, carry a gaze that is both piercing and unreadable.
A small silver ring glints on her left nostril, and multiple earrings adorn her ears, subtle but unmistakable details of her rebellious nature. She dresses in dark, edgy fashion—usually seen in her signature black leather jacket, layered over simple but well-chosen pieces. 
Paega moves with quiet confidence, her presence commanding attention without demanding it, provided by the experience she offers in her work.   

***Mien:*** Dark, slightly wild hair tumbles around her face and shoulders, blending seamlessly into the great, curved horns that rise from her head. The horns, thick and ridged like those of an ancient ram, mark her as something beyond human—something untamed.  A long scar runs from under her right eye down to her jaw line, more recent than any other marks. 
### ***Noticeable Effects***
- ***Dexterity 5, Athletics 5:*** Paega’s steps are confident, each movement precise and fluid, as if she were born to navigate both the seen and unseen paths of the world. There is an eerie smoothness to the way she moves, as though she is always aware of her surroundings, always anticipating the next step before she takes it.
- ***Wits 5, Acute Senses:*** Paega’s senses are razor-sharp, honed through years of traversing dangerous landscapes where a single misstep could mean death—or worse. She is intensely aware of her surroundings at all times, attuned to the smallest shifts in the air, the faintest flickers of movement in the periphery of her vision. Even in absolute darkness, she can detect the presence of others, the rhythm of their breath, the hesitation in their step.
## ***Personality***
Paega is a woman of action, not pretense. Practical and bold, she moves through the world with the confidence of someone who has seen it all and come out the other side unshaken. She doesn’t waste time on unnecessary words or pleasantries—her focus is on getting things done. Whether leading a wary traveler through the tangled paths of the hedge or escorting a desperate soul to the person they seek, she is steady, efficient, and unwavering in her purpose.
She knows the hedge like the back of her hand—its twists, its dangers, and the tricks it plays on the unprepared. Experience has made her sharp, not bitter; adaptable, not reckless. She doesn’t scare easily, nor does she indulge in pointless bravado. Paega is the kind of person who sizes up a situation in seconds and acts accordingly, relying on instinct and knowledge rather than luck.
Despite her striking, otherworldly appearance, she carries herself with an easy, grounded energy. She is casual, comfortable in her own skin, and unaffected by the opinions of others. She doesn’t posture or demand respect—she simply expects it. And for those who fail to recognize her competence, she lets her actions do the talking.
She isn’t one for unnecessary drama, but she also doesn’t tolerate nonsense. If someone needs a guide, she will lead them. If they hesitate, she will push them forward. And if they try to deceive or cross her—well, Paega knows every shortcut, every hidden turn, and every place where someone can disappear without a trace.

***Keeper***: [[The Devil at the Crossroads]]  
***Seeming:*** #Beast  
***Kith:*** Liminal  

***Court:*** [[The Court of Swords]]  
***Mantle:*** **Swords Warden (••)**  
**Responsibilities:**  The Warden moves beyond the perimeter. They are the blade drawn in silence—the ones who do not wait for the threat to arrive but seek it in the thorns and shadow. Acting as elite scouts, strike operatives, and enforcers, the Wardens root out threats before they reach the Freehold’s gates. Whether delving into Hedge realms, confronting hostile courts, or intercepting betrayals within, they are trusted to act swiftly and decisively.
Their authority extends beyond watching—they are now the first to act, the first to bleed, and often, the only warning others receive.

**Mantle Manifestation:** A low, predatory hum seems to vibrate in the air around them, as if the very atmosphere recognizes their primal nature. Their claws glint with a natural, untamed sharpness, and their presence exudes a quiet, unsettling intensity. The air feels heavier, charged with the scent of wild earth and fur. Shadows shift unnaturally in their wake, echoing the movement of a hunter on the prowl.

## ***Those with a shared Keeper may remember***
- Paega was a **Crossroads Warden for The Devil**, a role that placed her at the very threshold between the mortal world and the infernal abyss. An enforcer of the dark contracts that bound desperate souls to their fates.  Paega was trained to ensure that no deal went unfulfilled and no oath was broken without consequence. Her prowess as a sentinel was both promising and deadly, a reputation built upon years  of ruthless efficiency. 

- She **escorted travelers through Arcadia and the Hedge**, a duty that required not only skill but an intimate knowledge of the ever-shifting, treacherous paths between worlds. The Hedge was a labyrinth of thorns, illusions, and lurking dangers, while Arcadia itself was a realm of fickle wonders and cruel beauty. Navigating these spaces was no small feat, and Paega became **an expert at slipping between them, knowing where the safest crossings lay** and when to avoid the eyes of those who ruled these realms.
## Story Hooks

- Want to get through the dangerous paths of the Hedge? Paega knows the safest route—not just the well-worn paths but the hidden trails that shift when no one is looking, the ones that lead through the least treacherous parts of the bramble. She can hear the whispers of the thorns before they ensnare the unwary and sense the lurking dangers that hunger for lost travelers. Whether it's a quick passage, a hidden escape, or a perilous shortcut that others wouldn't dare to take, Paega walks the Hedge as if it were a second home. But safe passage always comes at a price.

- Want something protected in transit? Paega is more than just a guide; she’s a guardian, and her deadly claws have ended more than a few lives in the name of duty. Whether it’s an artifact too dangerous to fall into the wrong hands, a contract that must be delivered without interference, or even a person needing safe escort, she ensures that what is entrusted to her remains untouched. Thieves, predators, and would-be assassins have learned—some the hard way—that crossing Paega is a mistake few live to regret.

- The city itself is an open book. Once, these streets belonged to her, and now, she walks them again, herself with every alleyway, every hidden door, every shifting power that thinks itself beyond her notice. The undercurrents of the city's dealings, the whispers of bargains struck in the dark—Paega is intent on reclaiming her place within it all. The roads, the people, the secrets—soon, they will be hers again, just as they were before. And this time, she will ensure no one forgets it.

- Need something money can't buy—unless you know the right people? Paega's got you covered. She’s built a network of connections in places most people pretend don’t exist, the kind of friends who operate in the shadows, behind closed doors, and off the record. Whether it’s information, a rare item, or a favor that bends the rules, she’s the middleman you didn’t know you needed—but won’t regret having. Discretion is her currency, and trust? That’s something she trades in carefully. If you want something done, Paega knows who to call. The real question is—can you afford the cost?
