***Description:***
**Mask:** To those fooled by the Mask, Jack carries herself like she knows the odds and always bets on herself. Red hair tumbles around her face in loose waves that never settle, a shade that shifts between fire and copper. Freckles scatter across her face in a pattern only half remembered, edges blurred like they were painted on long ago. Her blue eyes hold a gambler's patience and her lips curl like she already knows how the game ends. Nobody ever smells it on her, but when she leaves there's a lingering scent of whiskey and cigars.

**Mien:** Jack is a girl who walked off of a card that was shuffled one too many times; her edges are frayed and her presence is never fully solid. Her hair is paper-white, smooth but stiff at the edges, curling like something once folded, never quite straight again. The ink-black of her eyes is absolute, swallowing reflections whole, as if nothing inside them was ever meant to be read. A faded red, unwavering smile is painted on to skin as pale as parchment left too long in the sun, a perfect trick of the hand. She smells of old pennies and worn velvet, of crisp paper softened by years in a gambler’s pocket, and of candle wax melted down to the wick.

***Personality:*** Jack talks fast, laughs easy, and pulls people in before they know they’re playing. She’s all warmth and confidence, the kind of charm that feels effortless—a friend they haven’t seen in years, a stranger who feels familiar, someone they want to believe. She’s always has all the right words, knows exactly when to tease, when to reassure, when to lay her cards down just enough to keep them hooked. She earns trust one well-placed smirk at a time and makes risk feel like a thrill rather than a mistake.

By the time they realize they should’ve been paying more attention, they’ve already shaken her hand, made the bet, and played their cards. And Jack? She never leaves the table empty-handed.

## Roleplay Hooks:
-# The following may not be known IC, but can be used to help determine what our characters have in common or for setting a scene.

**♦ The Devil at the Table:** Jack shows up at the right (or wrong) moment, sliding into a scene with a smirk and an offer. Need something? Looking for luck? Want to feel alive? She’s got you.

**♦ Debts, Favors & Unpaid Wagers:** Jack doesn’t forget the bets she wins—but she doesn’t always cash them in right away. Someone owes her, and she’s finally calling.

**♦ The Archivist:** She’s more than just a smooth talker, Jack knows how to dig. Old records, whispered rumors, half-forgotten histories—she can find the things people don’t want found. If you’re looking for information, she’s either already read it or knows where to start. But knowledge has a price—what are you willing to pay?

**♦ I Double Dog Dare You:** Jack believes in taking the chance, making the move, stepping into the moment before it slips away. Maybe you’re someone who needs that push. Maybe she’s the only one telling you to go for it. Maybe you love her for it, or maybe you resent her for making you believe you could be something more.

**♦ Fastest Hands in Town:** Jack’s fingers move quicker than most eyes can follow. Maybe you caught her lifting something she shouldn’t have, maybe you’re a fellow pickpocket, maybe you just noticed something in your pocket that wasn’t there before. Is it a game, a warning, or a test?
