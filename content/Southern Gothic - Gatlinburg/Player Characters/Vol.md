***Description:***

**Mask:** 
Vol is a man seen, but not always heard. When he speaks the timbre commands a room with a strange elegance that leaves an echo in its absence. Stoic to a fault, his pale heterochromic hazel eyes possess a distant wistful quality. Both present and afar, his motions are precise and purposeful.  Vol keeps his dark brown hair as precise as the rest of his features. Never out of place without purpose or intent. Olive-skinned and unmarred, it'd be hard to tell if he takes gratuitous effort to maintain his appearance, or is fortunate enough to always be that way. Almost never without his tailored black two-piece suit, he toes the line in his off-time between business professional and professor-chic. It always seems that a part of his features are veiled in angular shadows, adding an edge to his silhouette.

**Mien:**
The olive tone of his skin darkens to patches of flowing void. The voids flow and move around his features, always giving the impression that one could reach in further than his frame would allow. At times they threaten to envelope him entirely, leaving only a darkened silhouette in his wake. As he moves the patches linger and maintain a viscous flow rebounding against him as they catch up. His skin paled and frigid. Skin taught to his bones giving him a skeletal, sallow appearance. Only his face is bare in the light. A haunted hunger lingering behind his colourless eyes. Rather than glow and glimmer, the longer that Vol stays in a space, the darker it appears. The edge of his frame lined with an edge of darkened void that seems to seep into the space around him. When he speaks, those around him feel a sensation of loss and unsatisfied want.

***Personality:***
Vol is **eloquent**, **reserved**,  and exudes **a calculating intelligence**.  He's attentive to a fault, but courteous to others and graciously considerate of those he considers friends. He's stoic to a fault, and frequently will divert or misdirect to keep his thoughts and intent to himself. This can cause some to think he's wonderful, and others to question his motives. He is usually found admiring some sort of artwork or cultural piece--likely with intent to steal it for himself later. Vol always seems to be searching for more, **never** satisfied, he is constantly fighting with a void that he can't seem to sustain, putting him at risk as he dives from one event horizon to the next. Despite his own misgivings, he can be surprisingly compassionate, and will go out of his way to help those who might need it.

***Keeper:*** [[The Devil at the Crossroads]]
***Seeming:*** Fairest
***Kith:*** Helldiver

# Court: [[The Court of Pentacles]]

***Mantle:***  Pentacle Vertice (•)
***Responsibilities:*** The facilitators of the Court of Pentacles. They're the ones who source supplies for the Freehold and its members, retrieving it in any way necessary. Whatever needed. Traded. Found. Stolen. 
***Mantle Manifestation:*** Whenever searching for something the Freehold (or its members) need, there's a slight glimmer in the Vertice's eye.
***Effect:*** Trained Observer (•)

Pentacle's Lancet (••)
***Responsibilities:*** Intelligence actors for the Court of Pentacles, the Lancets are the ones who are tasked with uncovering threats to the Court and Freehold. Trained in infiltration, they're masters of shadows and obfuscation. Figments of other's imagination.
***Mantle Manifestation:*** Under light, shadows thrown by the Lancet's face occasionally shift into a form not their own.
***Effect:*** Light-Shy (Common Contract)

***Visible Effects:***
**Rigid and precise**, his features refuse to betray his inner thoughts. You'd be hard pressed to perceive anything beyond what he shows willingly.

***Those with a shared Keeper may remember:***
There was a time when the Devil's collection began to carry an extra weight with them. Looking at the *retrieved*, they could find the sensation of unsatisfied want lingering in its wake. Whispers of a thief that could **steal the darkness from night** had started to spread. Those who dealt with the Devil soon found themselves robbed of not only their bargains, but of **their favored aspects of self and sanity**. This favored shadow that in time dared to steal the **white from snow** for his conniving master.
