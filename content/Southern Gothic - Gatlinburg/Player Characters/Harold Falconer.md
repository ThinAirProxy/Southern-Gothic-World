***Description:***
**Mask:** Harold is an average man, dark shaggy hair falling in loose waves that frame his face. His ocean blue eyes are set a bit deeper in his face, the wrinkles surrounding them a compliment to his often too-knowing, distant gaze. He wears ill-fitting, worn-out clothes that are likely collected from coat drives and Church lost-and-founds, tending towards thick bluejeans and faded flannels under one heavy hunter green or tan-brown jacket.
**Mien:** Harold maintains the visage of bark skin, branches for hands and towering as horns from his head and roots trailing where his feet would have been. Deep blue eyes still set within the cracking bark, his smile is peaceful and he seems to shimmer in beams of sunlight.

***Personality:*** Harold is a soft-spoken man. He tends to keep to himself, but has a reputation for being reliable and always willing to go out of his way to help someone out when he can. He can seem standoffish, often lost in thought, but he is pleasant, polite, and honest. While Harry generally seems easygoing, he can get spaced out and drift into his own world. He easily spirals into an internal whirlwind of anxiety. He's never been good at hiding his emotions, and he's not the best liar - but he often lies by omission, opting to focus on silver linings rather than complain. He's the type to insult a bigot as a warning that precedes a right hook, though he rarely if ever resorts to violence.

Harry is a hyper-independent, self-sufficient man who finds immense purpose in being relied on. He gladly goes out of his way to assist others, whether they ask or not. Being a quiet type, he prefers small gestures of love (be they platonic or romantic) to grand gestures - though that has never kept him from planning something big. He'll deny credit for most things, bashfully humble and often overthinking whether or not he comes across as weird or flirtatious by virtue of doing favors. He is slow to ask for help; so slow, in fact, that he would first collapse under the strain of his burdens - self-imposed or otherwise - and apologize immediately after for making anyone around him fret. 

***Keeper:*** [[The Gnarled Old Crone]]
***Seeming:*** Wizened
***Kith:*** Woodblood

***Court:*** [[The Court of Cups]]
***Mantle:*** Gardener (•)

***Visible Effects:***
Mantle (••) Harold is enveloped by an ever-present scent of fresh grass before a thunderstorm. Sometimes, droplets of water dapple his Mien. Even in broad daylight, Harold appears as is he was standing over a pool of rippling water, reflected light dancing across his form.

***Those with a shared Keeper may remember:***
*The Whispering Copse*, a family of trees in the bog that seemed to chatter and whisper as they swayed in the ever-present breeze. One tree, larger than the others, seeming to hunch protectively over its neighbors.
