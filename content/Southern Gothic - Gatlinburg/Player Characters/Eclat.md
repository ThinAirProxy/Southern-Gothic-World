***Description:*** 
**Mask:** Eclat is a mix of contradictions. Hauntingly beautiful, warm and open, yet distant and detached. She holds the bearing of someone who can’t imagine why anyone would want to look at her, why they would want to notice her. Eclat is gorgeous in the way a painting is, the way a sculpture is. Something to be admired, to have emotions projected on and reflected at you, but not something that garners deeper investigation. She moves like a ghost in her own life, and in every room. She watches, observes, almost like she is untethered from the world. She dresses in simple yet elegant clothes; understated and muted in a way that somehow emphasizes her beauty instead of diminishing it.

**Mien:** Under the Glamour, Eclat retains her Arcadian visage as a living piece of art. Her hair is flecked with gold, and silver tear tracks fall perpetually down her cheeks, all the way to her fingers and toes. Her eyes look to be carved from diamond, and her flesh has patches of marble. Pain, loneliness, and beauty, all in one haunting persona.

***Personality:*** Eclat is meek, quiet, and unassuming. She can fade into the backdrop just as easily as she can dazzle like an artistic masterpiece. She listens more than she speaks, gauging what the other person needs most. Are they angry? Eclat knows the best words to soothe the fire. Are they sad? She knows that feeling intimately and can address it in others. Yet at the same time, it’s like she is hardly there, like she is a hundred miles away. She has spent all her life being unnoticed and unwanted, and she carries this with her even now that her beauty makes her the center of desire and admiration. Above all, she wishes to be truly seen, to be understood, yet she is convinced this is impossible. She has loved before, and believes love is something that is for everyone but herself. She inherently draws people in, but remains fearfully out of reach.

***Keeper:*** [[The Gluttonous Baron]]
***Seeming:*** Fairest
***Kith:*** Playmate

***Court:*** [[The Court of Cups]]
***Mantle:*** Heart's Reflection (•)

***Those with a shared Keeper may remember:*** A silent, sad being of precious pain and ethereal beauty, a set piece to be admired, made of the gems and stones acquired through the sweat, blood, and tears of her fellow Lost in the mines of the Baron.

***Not IC information***

***Forgotten pieces:*** Eclat knows she lost something in the Hedge when she escaped. She knows that her Fetch is supposed to be masquerading as her, that it's supposed to have her name. Why doesn't it? Why does everyone call her Virginia Kleine? Nonetheless, the Fairest something important to her is no longer there, no longer hers. Maybe you understand, maybe you can help her get it back?

***Whatever you need:*** Eclat has become a master of catering to the social needs of others. She can be a balm to your pain, a fuel to your dwindling fire, or the gentle squeeze of your hand that keeps you going. It's sometimes hard to tell if it's actually her, or if she's just making herself whoever she feels you want in the moment. But does it really matter?

***Alone in a crowded room:*** Eclat has spent her whole life being a ghost. No one so much as batted an eye at her before she was taken to Arcadia. That kind of loneliness doesn't just leave someone, and she carries that pain around with her always.  Will you be the one to look past the glimmer and the gold? To be one of the few people that actually *see* her? Will she let you?

***Lost love:*** Eclat can sometimes be found at the graveyard, vacant eyes staring at one particular gravestone as her never-ending stream of silver tears flow just a bit more readily. Who's name is written there? Why does the Fairest come here?
