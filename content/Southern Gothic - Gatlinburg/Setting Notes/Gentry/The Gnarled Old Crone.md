## **[[#The Gnarled Old Crone]]**  
  
A **twisted, ancient witch** of **swamps and cauldrons, of curses and transformations**. She does not steal—she **collects**, shaping those she takes into **new and terrible forms**. Beneath the **pale light of the shifting moon**, she stirs her **Endless Cauldron**, speaking the words that **unravel flesh and remake the soul**.  

**Titles:**  
- **The Black-Toothed Hag** *(Witch of the Forgotten Words)* – Marked by **a crooked grin of black, rotting teeth**, she speaks **spells that reshape reality** and twist the Wyrd itself.  
- **The Weaver of Night and Bone** *(Mistress of the Moon's Shadow)* – Wears **a cloak woven of darkness**, lined with **tiny bones that whisper in the wind**. She watches from the shadows, waiting for **the moment to reshape what is hers**.  
- **The Keeper of the Endless Cauldron** *(Mother of Change, Devourer of the Old)* – Holds **a great black iron cauldron**, from which **nothing escapes unchanged**.  

**Realm – The Hollowed Bog:**  
A **swamp of endless mist**, thick with **unseen creatures and half-formed things**. The **trees grasp like skeletal hands**, their **leaves dripping with black ichor**. The ground is **soft, hungry**, and the air **smells of old magic, damp earth, and decay**. At its center, upon a throne of **twisted roots**, the **Crone’s Cauldron bubbles**, waiting for the next thing to **become something new**.  

- The **moon is always present**, but it **shifts phases unpredictably**, changing the **rules of the realm**.  
- The waters are **alive**, reflecting not what is there, but **what could be**.  
- The trees **whisper secrets**, promising **power to those who listen, and doom to those who do not.**  

**Huntsmen of the Crone:**  
- **The Moon-Hollowed Hounds** – **Hairless, emaciated wolves** with **glowing, full-moon eyes**. They track their prey **not by scent, but by memory**, and their breath smells of **steamed herbs and boiling potion**.  
- **The Wretched Sisters** – **Twisted, melting figures**, their **limbs too long, their faces ever-changing**. They whisper **promises of transformation**, calling **the Lost home to the Cauldron’s embrace**.  

**Reason Why She Takes Humans:**  
She believes that **the world is unfinished**—that **humans are raw material, waiting to be perfected**. Those she takes are **melted down, reshaped, twisted into new things**. Some become **beasts**, some **servants**, and some are simply **stirred into the Cauldron**, their essence used to **fuel her endless work**. **To her, perfection is a process, and no one escapes it for long.**  

**What Kind of Fetch She Leaves Behind:**  
The **Crone’s Fetches are wrong**, always **off in a way that cannot be ignored**.  

- Some are made of **knotted roots and vines**, their **veins running with black sap**.  
- Others are shaped from **wet clay**, their **flesh soft, unfinished**, their **faces shifting in the moonlight**.  
- Many carry **eyes that do not belong to them**—the **eyes of cats, drowned things, or creatures that were never human**.  

Her Fetches are **not copies**—they are **prototypes**, imperfect things **still changing**, waiting for the moment when **the Crone calls them back to finish her work**.
