## **[[The Gluttonous Baron]]**  

**Concept:**  
A **bloated, corpulent king of industry**, a **monarch of soot and shadow**, seated upon **a throne of profit and misery**. He is **the endless hunger of unchecked greed**, the **unrelenting force of consumption**, the **owner of all things and the master of nothing**. He does not simply **take**—he **devours**, pulling **the desperate and the lost** into the endless depths of his **infernal coal mine**, where the **work never ends, and the debt is never repaid**.  

**Titles:**  
- **The Lord of the Bottomless Pit** *(The Hunger That Consumes, The Master Without Mercy)* – Wears **a rusted iron crown**, blackened with soot, heavier than it should be. He is the **endless mouth, the black hole where all things go to die**.  
- **The Smiling Bastard** *(The King of False Promises, The Hand That Signs the Deal)* – Wears **a fine waistcoat stretched tight over his bulk**, his **pockets heavy with stolen wealth, with contracts never meant to be honored**.  
- **The Baron of Smoke and Ash** *(The Choking Fog, The Breath of Industry)* – Carries **a thick cigar**, its smoke **choking, endless, filling the air with the scent of fire and forgotten hope**. His breath is **coal dust**, and his laugh is **the grinding of gears that will never stop turning**.  

**Realm – The Blackvein Mine:**  
A **labyrinthine coal mine that stretches infinitely downward**, where **lantern light flickers in the choking dark** and **no one ever sees the sky again**. The tunnels are **narrow and winding**, the air **thick with dust and sulfur**, and the **walls whisper promises of escape that never come true**.  

- **The deeper you go, the heavier you feel**, as if **the mine itself is swallowing you whole**.  
- **Veins of black gold pulse and throb**, as if the **coal is alive, as if it remembers what it once was**.  
- **The sound of pickaxes never stops**, though many who wield them **have long since turned to bone and dust**.  

At the heart of it all, **the Baron sits in his great counting house**, tallying **the debts that can never be repaid**, rolling **golden coins between his fingers**, each one stamped with the **faces of those who tried to escape**.  

**Huntsmen of the Baron:**  
- **The Pit-Born Foremen** – **Massive figures in ragged suits**, their skin **cracked like coal**, their **eyes burning with molten gold**. Their **whips do not lash flesh, but lash the soul**, dragging their victims **back to the mines even in their dreams**.  
- **The Penny-Faced Men** – **Thin, skeletal figures in worker’s garb**, their **faces nothing but smooth, featureless gold coins**. They **do not speak**, only stare, watching, waiting—**for when the debt must be paid**.

**Reason Why He Takes Humans:**  
To the **Baron**, there is **no such thing as freedom**. There is **only ownership, only labor, only the ever-turning machine of wealth and power**. Every human is **born into debt**, and **he alone collects what is owed**.  

- **He takes the desperate**, those who **have nothing left**, and **forces them into the mines**, where they **dig until their bodies fail, and then they dig some more**.  
- **He takes the prideful**, those who **thought they could escape the grasp of wealth and power**, and **makes them into servants**, **polishing his gold, counting his treasures, tallying the debts of all who have ever lived**.  
- **He takes the greedy**, those who **tried to hoard wealth for themselves**, and **turns them into veins of black gold**, pressed into the walls of his kingdom, forever part of his empire.  

There is no **release, no mercy**—only **work, only toil, only the endless hunger of the mine**.  

**What Kind of Fetch He Leaves Behind:**  
His Fetches are **hollow, driven by purpose that they cannot understand**, slaves to a life of **endless labor, endless want**.  

- Some are **stitched from burlap sacks**, stuffed with **coal and blackened paper money**, their **joints creaking, their eyes nothing but rusted pennies pressed into place**.  
- Others are **made of bone and ash**, their **skin dry, cracking like parched earth**, forever **hungry, forever reaching for something they can never have**.  
- Some are **nothing but empty suits**, their **bodies held together by strings of contracts**, their **voices a faint, rasping echo of a life they barely remember**.  

His Fetches do not **live**—they **persist**, caught in **the same endless machine that powers his realm**, waiting for **the day the Baron calls them back to work**.
