# The Major Arcana Titles

### ***The Lost of Gatlinburg formed together in a Freehold, much like a deck of tarot cards cobbled together from disparate decks...***

In addition to Mantles, Lost here in the Freehold of Hills and Hollar have extra duties and responsibilities available to them to help serve the Freehold in the form of manifested Major Arcana titles granted by the bargain of the Freehold. 

These can be earned - and can be lost. Titles will manifest, face, or shift, depending on the fate of the Lost as determined by the Wyrd.

A Lost may only hold one of these titles in addition to their Mantle, and only one title may be claimed at a time (save for The Lovers). None of these titles hold any importance over the other, nor are they bound by gender, and are seen as equal titles in their own right, just with unique domains. Every Title has an Upright and Reverse effect of their respective Boon. The Reverse will almost always have the same effect, but with a consequence.

A title starts in the Upright position, however the Wyrd has a way of balancing the act of wielding it. After using a title’s boon regardless of position (Upright or Reversed), roll Wyrd. On a success, the title flips position.

It will be at Staff discretion what one manifests, and for who, and whether it needs to change or fade. If players feel they have a compelling pitch for one manifesting for their character, they are welcome to open a plot ticket. It is expected every character will have a chance at manifesting one over time. 

**Every Major Arcana title possess the following drawback:**
`Twisting and weaving the fate of the Wyrd into ones Mien is never without risk. When determining the distance at which a character alerts fae creatures and opens Hedge gateways when dropping their Mask, they are considered to be effectively 1 stronger than their Wyrd rating. This cannot be negated by the Dull Beacon merit.`

**What boon each title bestows will not be known until it manifests on a Changeling. **

---
## **O. The Fool**
The Fool embodies the spirit of boundless potential, unpredictability, and fearless exploration. They walk the Hedge and the mortal world with an air of reckless wisdom, stepping where others hesitate, laughing in the face of fate, and finding opportunities where others see only danger.

## **I. The Magician**
The Magician is a master of willpower, transformation, and control over the forces of the world. They are the bridge between potential and action, a wielder of power who bends fate to their desires. Whether they are a con artist, a stage performer, an occultist, or perhaps even a true sorcerer, they are always one step ahead, making the impossible seem effortless.

Current holder: [[Rhys]]

 
```
As Above, So Below:

Upright: Once per Chapter, The Magician may spend 1 Glamour to produce exactly what they need in the moment, as long as it could have reasonably been on their person or in their environment. This can be an escape tool, a crucial document, or even the right words to say.  

Reverse: Once per Chapter, The Magician may spend 1 Glamour to produce exactly what they need in the moment, but also gain the Shaken condition as the act of reaching beyond feels like it reached back.
```

## **II. The High Priestess**
The High Priestess is a keeper of mysteries, a bridge between the seen and unseen. They move through the world with quiet knowing, their presence tinged with an aura of deep intuition and veiled wisdom. Others may seek their guidance, drawn to the way they seem to understand things left unspoken.

Current holder: None

## **III. The Empress**
The Empress is a symbol of fertility, nurturing, and the abundant, creative energy that flows through nature. They are a caretaker, a creator, and a protector of the natural world, embodying the balance between beauty, growth, and emotional depth. When they speak, their voice carries the weight of authority and compassion, and when they act, they bring forth new life, ideas, and opportunities.

Current holder: None

## **IV. The Emperor**
A foundation of stone, an unbroken line—where others falter, The Emperor endures. Where others doubt, they decree. Strength is not merely held; it is given, forged in the hands of those who would wield it.

Current holder: None

## **V. The Hierophant**
The Hierophant stands as the keeper of sacred knowledge, a bridge between the mortal and the divine, the past and the present. They are the voice of tradition, the guardian of structure, and the wielder of rites that shape the faithful. Their words are not mere counsel—they are doctrine, carrying the weight of generations, etched into the bones of those who listen. 

Current holder: None

## **VI. The Lovers**
The Lovers are never alone. Whether bound by devotion or entangled by fate, their power is shared—greater together than apart. They are two halves of a whole, a single melody played in harmony, resonating through the Wyrd itself. But love is not only sweetness; it is choice, consequence, and sacrifice. When they stand united, they are unshaken. When they drift apart, the echoes of absence reverberate through their souls.

***There must be two Lovers for the ability to work.***

Current holder(s): None

## **VII. The Chariot**
The Chariot does not ask permission—it surges forward, driven by sheer will and an unyielding desire to conquer whatever lies ahead. Where others falter, the Chariot persists, forging a path through obstacles, opposition, and uncertainty. Strength alone does not steer this course; it is determination, the unshakable conviction that no force, no doubt, no fear will break their momentum. The road may twist, and the wheels may shake, but the Chariot does not stop.

Current holder: [[Pæga]]
```
Unstoppable Momentum:
Upright: Once per chapter, the Chariot may spend 1 Glamour to ignore any Condition, Tilt, or supernatural effect that would hinder their movement or progress for the rest of the scene. This includes grappling, supernatural restraints, or mental influences that attempt to slow or stop them. 

Reversed: Once per chapter, the Chariot may spend 1 Glamour to ignore any Condition, Tilt, or supernatural effect that would hinder their movement or progress for the rest of the scene. This includes grappling, supernatural restraints, or mental influences that attempt to slow or stop them. However, their momentum makes them lose sight of everything around them. The Chariot will fail any Perception roll, and any failure in the scene that is not to do with their goal will count as a Dramatic Failure.

## **VIII. Strength**
Strength is not brute force, nor is it the absence of fear—it is mastery over the self, the quiet power that soothes the raging storm rather than fights it. It is the hand that tames the lion, the voice that calms the restless heart. True strength is not about overpowering others but about commanding one's own instincts, transforming raw emotion into unwavering resolve.

Current holder: None

## **IX. The Hermit**
The Hermit’s path is a lonely one, but in solitude, wisdom sharpens and instincts refine. Away from the distractions of others, they walk the narrow road of self-reliance, their lantern casting just enough light to guide their next step. Yet the further they go, the harder it becomes to turn back—to remember what it was to walk among others, rather than apart from them

Current holder: None

## **X. Wheel of Fortune**
The Wheel of Fortune spins ceaselessly, its cycles governing the ebb and flow of fate. Each turn brings new opportunities and challenges, reminding us that change is the only constant. Embracing this ever-turning wheel means accepting the unpredictable nature of life, finding balance amidst its fluctuations, and understanding that both highs and lows are integral parts of the journey.

Current holder: None

## **XI. Justice**
Justice stands tall, their gaze unwavering, as they balance the scales of fairness in one hand and raise the sword of truth in the other. They see beyond bias to weigh each matter with equal measure. In their presence, the scales tip neither towards mercy nor severity but remain balanced, reflecting the equilibrium of cause and effect. They remind us that justice is not merely a system of laws but a universal principle, ensuring that every action finds its rightful consequence.

Current holder: None

## **XII. The Hanged Man**
Suspended in stillness, The Hanged Man hangs between one breath and the next, where the world turns quietly upside down. They do not struggle, do not reach—they release, surrendering to the hush that comes before understanding. Bound by choice, not chains, they let the old world fall away like leaves in wind, and in that inverted silence, truth reveals itself, strange and shining. Enlightenment is not seized, but glimpsed—in the pause, in the waiting, in the willingness to fall to rise anew.

Current holder: None

## **XIII. Death**
Death walks the threshold where all things end and begin, robed not in horror but in inevitability. Where they pass, doors close—but always so that others may open. Their touch is not cruel; it is cleansing, a cold wind that strips what no longer serves. To meet Death is not to vanish—it is to be remade. Transformation lies in their shadow, quiet and certain. Those who embrace the letting go find not emptiness, but the raw soil of something new. They are the silence after the last note, the inhale before the next song begins.

Current holder: None

## **XIV. Temperance**
Temperace stands where rivers meet, one foot in each current, hands ever moving—pouring, balancing, blending. In their presence, chaos softens and opposites find harmony. They are the stillness between heartbeats, the alchemy of restraint and grace. Temperance does not rush; they stir the world gently, folding fire into water until it sings. They teach that the path forward is not chosen in haste, but measured in quiet sips—patience, balance, and the sacred art of becoming whole.

Current holder: None

## **XV. The Devil**
In the flickering shadows, The Devil sits at the crossroads of temptation and surrender. They beckon with a crooked smile, inviting indulgence, inviting attachment, drawing others into the grasp of their own shadow selves. Here, desire runs wild, and the world of restriction becomes a gilded cage. Yet, in their eyes, there lies a reflection: the truth that no chain is forged without consent, and freedom lies only in the act of release.

Current holder: None

## **XVI. The Tower**
With a single strike, The Tower shatters the illusion of stability. The air crackles with energy as the walls built on false foundations crumble to dust, revealing the raw chaos beneath. Thunder rumbles, and lightning splits the sky—sudden, violent, yet cleansing. In this destruction, there is revelation; in this upheaval, an awakening. The one who holds The Tower stands as a harbinger of transformation, their presence a force that breaks through complacency, forcing change to rise from the ashes of the old.

Current holder: None

## **XVII. The Star**
The Star shines not with brilliance, but with quiet constancy—a distant light that endures even when all else falls away. They are the promise whispered in the dark, the hush after ruin, the soul’s instinct to reach for grace. In them lives a hope that is not naïve but hard-won, rising from the ashes of despair. They do not command faith—they kindle it, gently, like a hand cupped around a flickering flame. To follow The Star is to remember purpose in the wake of loss, to find one’s reflection in the vast stillness of night, and know that even the farthest light can guide you home.

Current holder: None

## **XVIII. The Moon**
The Moon walks the twilight path between knowing and unknowing, where the edges of reality bleed into dream. The Moon sees through veils, not by piercing them, but by understanding their dance. They speak in riddles and silences, in flickers at the corner of your eye. Their presence unsettles—not by malice, but by drawing out the truths you’ve buried, the fears you’ve painted over with reason. The Moon does not chase clarity; they cradle mystery, illuminating just enough to guide the lost… or lead them deeper.

Current holder: None

![[XVIII. The Moon.png]]

---
## **XIX. The Sun**
The Sun arrives like the dawn—golden, radiant, impossible to ignore. Where they walk, shadow retreats and colour returns to the world, as if memory itself dares to bloom again in their light. Their laughter is a balm, their warmth a shield against the creeping cold of doubt. Even in darkness, they are a reminder that joy is not a weakness but a weapon, defiant and bright. The Sun carries with them the promise of life after sorrow, of play after pain. They do not banish the night—they simply outshine it.

Current holder: None

## **XX. Judgement**
Judgement is the sounding bell at twilight, the voice that rises from deep within when all other noise has faded. Called by something older than memory, they walk the path between what was and what must be, shedding former skins with grace and gravity. Their presence is a reckoning—not of punishment, but of truth revealed, of purpose unearthed. They see through masks, theirs and others’, and speak with the weight of lived lives and chosen change. Judgement is not cruel; it is clarity. And in their gaze, one may see not what they are, but what they are meant to become.

Current holder: None

![[XX. Judgement.png]]

---
## **XXI. The World**
The World is a symbol of completion, fulfilment, and mastery of a journey. The World is the custodian of the Freehold’s history, tasked with knowing where and what the Lost have been and how that may shape what they will become. They stand above and apart from courtly politics, and bear the weight of many cycles on their shoulders—not merely as witness, but as weaver. In them, the stories converge: flight and fall, return and reckoning.
