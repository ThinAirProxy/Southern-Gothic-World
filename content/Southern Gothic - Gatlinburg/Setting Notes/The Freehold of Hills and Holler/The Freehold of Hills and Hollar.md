## **The Freehold of Hills and Hollar**  
*"Fortune turns, and we turn with it. The cards are drawn, the story unfolds."*  

The **Freehold of Hills and Hollar** is a sanctuary for the Lost amidst the **rolling mist-covered mountains, neon-drenched tourist traps, and forgotten places where the Wyrd runs deep**. Nestled in **Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge**, the Freehold thrives in a region where **the veil between worlds is thin**, where the winding roads lead to **hidden hollows and secret paths into the Hedge**.  

Gatlinburg is a town of **constant change**, where tourists arrive **by the thousands**, staying **for a moment before vanishing into memory**. The **locals remain**, holding onto the **traditions and superstitions that whisper of things lurking in the woods**. The Freehold exists in this delicate balance—**between the fleeting and the permanent, between the wandering and the rooted**.  

### **The Tarot and the [[Courts]]**  
Unlike many Freeholds that follow **the seasons**, the Lost of Hills and Hollar look instead to **the cards of fate**. Their **courts are bound to the Suits of the Tarot**, each representing a different **approach to survival, power, and resistance against the Gentry**. These courts shift their rule not by the calendar but **by the turning of fortune itself**, ensuring that **no single path dominates for too long**.  

Each transition is marked by **a grand reading**, where **the cards of fate** determine which Court **will hold dominion**. This ritual is an act of **both prophecy and politics**, guided by the **Mystagogues of the Deck**, those who read the flow of power in the Freehold's **chosen tool of divination**.  

### **A City of Tourists, A Haven for the [[Lost]]**  
The Freehold exists in a place where **most people never stay for long**. This transient nature makes it **dangerous but also powerful**—**the Gentry struggle to track those who are constantly moving**, and the **Lost who call this place home have learned to blend in among the ever-changing faces**. The **constant influx of people** allows for **easy feeding of Glamour**, but it also makes **establishing long-term stability a challenge**.  

For the Freehold, **identity is both a mask and a weapon**. They **use the chaos of the tourist world to hide**, but they also know that **anyone could vanish and be forgotten in an instant**.

### **[[The Major Arcana]] and Freehold Titles**  
Power within the Freehold is reflected in **the Major Arcana**, with roles and responsibilities tied to **the cards of fate**. These titles are not just names but **mantles of power, fate-bound positions that shape the destiny of those who hold them**.  

Some titles reflect **leadership and governance**, while others represent **wisdom, mystery, and challenge**. Those who hold these roles are **not merely rulers but symbols**, living embodiments of **the Freehold’s ongoing story**. These positions shift with time, passed from one to another **through fate, challenges, or necessity**, ensuring that **power remains dynamic, never static**.  

### **The Freehold’s Strengths & Struggles**  
The **Lost of Hills and Hollar** survive **because they adapt, because they read the currents of fate**, and because they understand **that nothing is permanent**—not power, not safety, not even themselves. But this transience is **both their greatest strength and their greatest weakness**.  

- **They are hard to track**, always moving, always shifting.  
- **They blend into the ever-changing tides of tourists and travelers**, using the chaos to their advantage.  
- **They know that the Gentry watch the mountains**, and so they guard the hidden paths that lead into the dark places where Arcadia **presses too close to reality**.  

But at the same time:  

- **They struggle to hold onto stability**, for nothing in this place ever lasts.  
- **They must be careful not to forget themselves**, lest they **become just another fleeting shadow in a town of strangers**.  
- **They must fight to ensure that, even in a place of transition, the Freehold remains firm and unshaken.**  

Because at the end of the day, the Gentry **never stop hunting**, and the Lost must be ready **to turn the cards in their favor—before someone else does it for them.**

# **The Freehold Oath of Hills and Hollar**

>By **Sword** of air, my will I give,  
To guard the Freehold where I live.  
By **Wand** of fire, my spark I share,  
To rise and build, to dream and dare.  
By **Cup** of tears, my heart I bind,  
To kin and Court, to hope and mind.  
By **Coin** of stone, I plant my name,  
To hold this land through storm and flame.

>I will not kneel to Gentry’s chains,  
Nor heed Their songs, nor serve Their games.  
No mask I wear shall speak Their lies,  
No hand shall help Their cruel disguise.

>I serve the Freehold, bold and true,  
In all I say, in all I do.  
Until the Crown shall set me free,  
Or death unbinds what oath may be.

>In breath, in blood, in glamour spun,  
So swears the Lost beneath the sun.  
Let Wyrd now weave and bear me tight—  
This oath I swear by star and night.
