**♥ The Court of Cups – The Longing**  
*"We are the dream unfulfilled, the song that lingers in silence."*  

**Names of the Court:**  
- **The Veiled Court**  
- **The Court of the Sorrowed Moon**  
- **The Order of the Pearl Chalice**  

**The Court’s Emotion:**  
- **Longing** – Love, nostalgia, regret, and yearning.  

**Nicknames for Members:**  
- **Formal:** **Echoes**  
- **Informal:** **Drifters**  
- **Derogatory:** **Widows** (Mourning what is lost)  

**What They Value:**  
The **Court of Cups** believes that **longing is power**—the things we **ache for, regret, or dream of** shape us more than what we have. They **hold on to the past**, knowing that **memory and emotion are the truest weapons against the Gentry**. Whether they **chase lost love, mourn a life they can never return to, or seek answers that will never come**, they know that **what we yearn for defines us**.  

**What the Court is Like When They Rule the Freehold:**  
- The **Freehold becomes a sanctuary of dreams, secrets, and whispered truths**.  
- **The Gentry must obey hospitality**—they **cannot harm a guest, break a vow, or manipulate emotions** within the Freehold.  
- **Hidden memories rise to the surface**, and those who try to **bury the past find it coming back to haunt them**.  
- **Oneiromancy flourishes**—dreams become a battlefield where **secrets are both weapons and shields**. *** All Oneiromancy rolls gain the 9-Again property. ***

**What the Court is Like When They Are Not Ruling:**  
- They act as **confidants, historians, and dreamwalkers**, uncovering truths others try to forget.  
- They **dwell in memory**, walking the dreams of mortals and changelings alike.  
- They offer **counsel, comfort, and warnings**, though rarely direct action.  

**Why People Want to Join Them:**  
- If you have **a regret, a lost love, or a past you cannot let go of**, Cups **understands you**.  
- They help you **remember, heal, or embrace your pain** instead of denying it.  
- If you want **to know the hidden truths of dreams, love, and loss**, this Court will **open the door**.  

**Why People Love Them:**  
- They are **deep, understanding, and empathetic**.  
- They **carry forgotten stories, protect lost love, and help others process their pain**.  
- They are **mystics, poets, and dreamers**—their words **linger like the last notes of a song**.  

**Why People Hate Them:**  
- They are **melancholic, slow to act, and often weighed down by grief**.  
- They **cling to the past** rather than **move forward**, sometimes **dragging others down with them**.  
- They know **too much about everyone**—their insights are **a blessing and a curse**.  

**What Their Mantle Looks Like:**  
- **The scent of saltwater, old perfume, and rain-soaked earth**.  
- **A faint, ghostly echo of voices around them**, whispering half-remembered words.  
- **Water pools at their feet, even when the ground is dry**.  
- When they weep, **their tears shimmer like pearls, and their reflections in glass delay before matching their movements**.  

**What Kind of Courtiers Are in the Court:**  
- **Dreamwalkers and seers** who **navigate the subconscious**.  
- **Lovers and poets**, caught in **the ache of what was**.  
- **Oracles and mystics**, pulling **secrets from memory, fate, and dream**.  
- **Keepers of lost things**, those who preserve **what others have abandoned**.

# The Pearl Goblet

The **Pearl Goblet** is a chalice of **elegant, otherworldly craftsmanship**, its bowl formed from a single, massive **iridescent pearl**, polished until it gleams with shifting hues of **blue, violet, and rose gold**. The stem and base are made of **silver filigree**, wrapped in intricate patterns that seem to pulse faintly in time with the heartbeat of anyone nearby. Inside, it always holds a small amount of **glistening, dreamlike liquid**—its surface never still, reflecting memories long since lost and feelings never spoken aloud.  
The Goblet carries with it the **essence of healing and longing**—the foundation of the Court of Cups. It was said to be poured from the waters of the Dreaming Roads, steeped in emotion and sealed by vow.  
### **Effects:**  
Once per scene, a changeling may **drink from the Pearl Goblet**, healing **2 levels of Lethal damage** or **4 levels of Bashing damage**. Alternatively, they may choose to spend **1 point of Glamour** as they drink to heal **1 level of Aggravated damage**.  
When used to tend to another's wounds, the Goblet imparts a **momentary glimpse** of the drinker's deepest memory or emotion—**a price of connection** for the healing it offers.  
### **Drawback:**  
The Goblet cannot be filled. It always holds just enough for **one sip**—and only those touched by the Wyrd may drink. Mortals who attempt to sip from it **see nothing, feel nothing**, and are left **haunted by the absence of something they can't remember**.  
It is said that the Goblet is **heavy to carry for too long**—not in weight, but in emotion. To hold it too long is to feel the ache of everyone it has healed. If carried with the user, they take -3 wound penalties on all actions as if their right most health box is filled, this is in effect even if they don't normally have wound penalties.
