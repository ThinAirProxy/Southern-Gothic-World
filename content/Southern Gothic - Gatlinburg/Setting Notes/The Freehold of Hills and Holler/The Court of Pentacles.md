# **The Onyx Coin**  

The **Onyx Coin** is a **heavy, palm-sized disc of polished black stone**, its surface **so smooth and dark it seems to drink in the light** around it. Faint veins of **deep violet and silver** ripple through the stone, barely visible unless turned at just the right angle. The edges are **worn but unchipped**, as if time itself has failed to erode its presence. One side bears an **engraving of an ancient tree**, its roots twisting into **the shape of grasping hands**, while the other is stamped with a **featureless, hollowed-out mask**—a symbol of **secrets kept and identities lost.** When held, it carries an unnatural **weight**, not just of stone, but of **something deeper, something buried.**  
#### **Effects**  
The **Onyx Coin** grants its wielder the ability to **bend fate in their favor**—or curse another’s fortune. When any **dice pool is rolled** by anyone within sight, including the wielder themselves, they may **spend 1 Glamour and 1 Willpower reflexively** to force the roll to be **rolled twice**, allowing them to choose which result to keep.  
### **Catch**  
The wielder may **choose not to spend the Glamour and Willpower**, but **bad fortune** will come for them instead. The next time they make a roll, **they must roll twice and take the worse of the two results.**  
### **Drawback**  
If used **twice in one scene**, the **coin vanishes**, slipping from the wielder’s grasp and **appearing in the possession of another member of the Freehold at random**. The new holder cannot **pass it off to another** until they have used its power at least once. The **Onyx Coin** chooses its bearers—and it does not stay in one hand for long.
