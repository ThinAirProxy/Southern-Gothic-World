# **The Silver Sword**  

The **Silver Sword** is more than just an emblem of the **Court of Swords**—it is a manifestation of **oaths unbroken, battles fought, and the unrelenting will of those who wield it.** A relic forged not of mere metal, but of **purpose and power**, it does not simply serve its master—it becomes **an extension of them.**  

When grasped, the **Silver Sword** does not hold a single shape. Instead, it shifts, morphs, and **conforms to the wielder’s nature**, taking the form of the **weapon they wield best.** For some, it is a **shimmering longsword**, for others, a **mighty warhammer, a brutal gauntlet, a deadly axe, or even a pair of curved blades.** Whatever form it takes, its **purpose remains the same**—to **strike down opposition with unerring force and resolve.**  

The **weapon’s very essence is alive with the Wyrd**, humming with an **ever-present energy**, its surface reflecting an **impossible gleam of shifting colors**, as though catching the light of every realm it has passed through. It carries with it the **weight of old battles, the echoes of sworn vows**, and the **undeniable presence of a force meant to cut through weakness, deception, and fear.**  

## **Stats:**

## **Effects:**  
### **Variable Form:**  
> The **Silver Sword** reshapes itself into the **weapon best suited for its wielder’s fighting style**, ensuring they **always strike with confidence and skill.** The wielder may use **Strength, Dexterity, or Presence** plus **Brawl, Weaponry, or Intimidation** when making melee attacks with this weapon.  

To wield the **Silver Sword** is to take up the mantle of a **warrior, a protector, a leader.** It is not merely a weapon—it is **a vow made manifest, a blade forged of purpose, and an unyielding force against the darkness.**
