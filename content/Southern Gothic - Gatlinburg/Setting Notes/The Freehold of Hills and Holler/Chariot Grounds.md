# *A battlefield for those who seek mastery over their fate.*

**Chariot Grounds** stands as a sacred arena deep within **[[The Forest of Gold and Flames]]**, a liminal space where destiny is forged in fire and reflection. Encircled by towering trees with trunks of burnished gold, their leaves whispering in the phantom wind, the arena is both a battlefield and a proving ground. The ever-burning flames lick at the treeline, their flickering light casting long, shifting shadows over the ancient stone ruins that frame the space.

At its heart, a wide circular basin gleams like liquid gold, mirroring the inferno that rages around it. The surface shimmers unnaturally, as though it is both solid and fluid, a threshold to something deeper, something waiting. The worn stone steps leading down into the arena are lined with broken pillars, remnants of an age long past, their silent watch over the combatants unyielding.

A single archway stands at the far end, untouched by the consuming fire, its purpose unknown—perhaps an exit, a gateway, or a passage to something greater. Here, under the watchful gaze of the blazing trees, warriors come to test their mettle, bound by an unspoken contract of strength, sacrifice, and fate. Those who enter the Chariot Grounds do not merely fight—they *become* part of the legend, their names whispered in the embers long after they have left the ring.

## **Effigy Tokens**  

### **Concept & Purpose**  
Paega has established a dedicated sparring ground within the Hedge, now known as Chariot Grounds, where the Lost can train and test their combat skills without lasting physical consequences. The goal is to create a space where Changelings can fight freely, push their limits, and hone their abilities while ensuring that injuries sustained within the ring do not carry beyond its boundaries.  

## **Effigy Token**  

### **Effects**  
By creating a small effigy infused with a piece of the fighter—be it a strand of hair, a drop of blood, or a piece of clothing—the token binds itself to its owner for the duration of the match. While inside the sparring ring, all damage inflicted on the fighter is transferred to the effigy instead. The fighter will still feel the pain and impact, but once they step out of the ring, their body is restored to full health—provided the effigy’s durability hasn’t been exceeded.  

The magic of the Effigy is strictly bound to the arena. It cannot be used outside of the designated space, nor can it be manipulated for combat beyond training purposes. The arena itself becomes a site of sacred, unbreakable law—injuries sustained within its bounds stay within its bounds.  

However, there is a limit. Once the Effigy has absorbed all the damage it can endure, it crumbles—its magic spent. Any further damage inflicted upon the fighter is *real*, with no protections offered.  

## **Mechanics**  
- **Pool:** Resolve + Athletics/Brawl/Firearms/Weaponry/Occult
- **Cost:** 1 Glamour by the creator + 1 Willpower by the fighter (can be the same person)  
- **Success:** The Effigy absorbs up to the fighter’s full Health in Lethal damage.  
- **Exceptional Success:** The Effigy can endure up to the fighter’s full Health in Aggravated damage.  

**Potential Risk:**  
The crafting of these tokens bears an eerie resemblance to the creation of a Fetch—an echo of something not quite alive, but bound to the essence of its subject. On a **Failure** the process triggers a **Breaking Point (1 die roll)** as the Lost is forced to confront the nature of their own stolen identity. The effigy is still created with a health pool of 5L.
