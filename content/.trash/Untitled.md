### **[[#The Forest of Gold and Flames]]**  
*"The trees burn, but they do not burn out. The leaves fall, but they never touch the ground."*  

The **Forest of Gold and Flames** is a place of **eternal autumn**, where the **trees glow with the light of molten gold and flickering embers**. The **leaves burn as they fall**, drifting on the wind like **dying stars**. The ground is **warm, cracked like cooling lava**, and the air smells of **fire, sap, and something sweetly poisonous**.  

The forest is **treacherous, but beautiful**—a place where **goblin fruits grow rich and potent, where the trees whisper secrets, and where the desperate can bargain for power at great cost**. But **step wrong, anger the flames, or let your greed take hold**, and the **forest will consume you in fire, leaving nothing but gold dust behind**.  

- **Dangers:** The **Burning Stags**, creatures of flame and antlers, who hunt those who stray too far.  
- **Rewards:** **Goblin fruits of great power**, growing among **the molten roots of the oldest trees**.  
- **Paths:** Trods shift like fire—they **may be open one night and gone the next**, leaving travelers lost among the burning leaves.
