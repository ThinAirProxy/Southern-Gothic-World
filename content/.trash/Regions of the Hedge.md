### **[[#The Forest of Gold and Flames]]**  
*"The trees burn, but they do not burn out. The leaves fall, but they never touch the ground."*  

The **Forest of Gold and Flames** is a place of **eternal autumn**, where the **trees glow with the light of molten gold and flickering embers**. The **leaves burn as they fall**, drifting on the wind like **dying stars**. The ground is **warm, cracked like cooling lava**, and the air smells of **fire, sap, and something sweetly poisonous**.  

The forest is **treacherous, but beautiful**—a place where **goblin fruits grow rich and potent, where the trees whisper secrets, and where the desperate can bargain for power at great cost**. But **step wrong, anger the flames, or let your greed take hold**, and the **forest will consume you in fire, leaving nothing but gold dust behind**.  

- **Dangers:** The **Burning Stags**, creatures of flame and antlers, who hunt those who stray too far.  
- **Rewards:** **Goblin fruits of great power**, growing among **the molten roots of the oldest trees**.  
- **Paths:** Trods shift like fire—they **may be open one night and gone the next**, leaving travelers lost among the burning leaves.

![[The Smokey Mountain.png]]
### **[[#The Smokey Mountain]]**  
*"The smoke rolls in like a tide, thick and endless. The higher you climb, the less you can see."*  

The **Smokey Mountain** is **tall, silent, and veiled in an endless rolling fog**. It is **not snow that covers its peaks, but smoke**, so **thick and heavy that even sound struggles to pass through it**. Those who try to **climb to the summit** often find themselves **turned around, descending the same paths they swore they had just climbed**.  

This is a place of **lost things**, where **the echoes of those who failed to escape the Gentry linger**. The smoke is **alive, shifting and whispering**, sometimes forming **figures that feel almost familiar**. Some say the mountain is **watching**, choosing who is allowed to reach its peak and who is meant to wander forever.  

- **Dangers:** The **Hollow Men**, figures that **lurk in the fog, their faces missing, their voices stolen**.  
- **Rewards:** **Safe paths through the Hedge**, known only to those **who can read the smoke**.  
- **Paths:** The **higher you climb, the harder it is to breathe, to think, to remember**—the mountain does not let go easily.

![[The Valley of Stars.png]]
### **[[#The Valley of Stars]]**  
*"The darkness has weight. The light moves in shapes not meant for mortal eyes."*  

The **Valley of Stars** is **a place where the world drops away**, a valley so **deep and vast that no light from above ever reaches its floor**. The only illumination comes from **the creatures that dwell in its depths**, bioluminescent and strange, casting **ghostly lights in the eternal dark**.  

To look down into the valley is **to feel like you are standing at the edge of the sky**, staring into **a reflection of the night, but twisted, wrong, infinite in ways the mind cannot process**. Those who descend must **navigate by the shifting constellations of the living things below**, lest they fall into the depths **where no one has ever returned from**.  

- **Dangers:** The **Echoing Hunger**, a thing that **lives in the deepest parts of the valley**, swallowing light, sound, and memory.  
- **Rewards:** **Secrets lost to time**, buried in the dark where **even the Gentry do not reach**.  
- **Paths:** The deeper you go, the **more you forget the sky**, the harder it is to **remember if you were ever meant to leave**.

![[The Caves of Bones.png]]
### **[[#The Caves of Bones]]**  
*"The walls remember. Every step is a history written in dust and marrow."*  

Beneath the mountains, **deep below the Hedge, the caves twist endlessly**, their **walls lined with the bones of creatures that have died in these hills**. Some are **ancient**, brittle and **fused into the rock itself**. Others are **fresh**, the marrow still lingering.  

The tunnels are **silent, save for the distant, rhythmic sound of dripping water**, a sound that some claim is **not water at all, but something deeper, something waiting**. The bones **hold memories**, and those who can listen **may learn the truths buried in the dark**. But **disturb the dead too much, and the caves will remember you, too**.  

- **Dangers:** The **Whispering Remains**, bones that still **speak, move, and call to those who pass through**.  
- **Rewards:** **Knowledge of the past**, waiting to be **plucked from the marrow of the dead**.  
- **Paths:** The deeper you go, the **more the walls shift, sealing behind you, leading you toward places best left undisturbed**.
