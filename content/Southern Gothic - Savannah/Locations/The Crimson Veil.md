# The Crimson Veil  
***Owner:*** [[Beau Underwood]] (Keeper)
***Location:*** In the heart of Savannah’s bustling downtown, tucked between a row of trendy bars and restaurants.  

***Description:***  
The Crimson Veil is a high-end nightclub that serves as one of Savannah’s Elysium locations, its crimson-lit exterior and velvet rope entrance inviting Kindred and mortals alike into its sultry embrace. The club’s modern aesthetic is laced with gothic undertones, featuring dark wood, wrought iron fixtures, and crimson accents throughout. The thrum of music, the flash of dim lighting, and the buzz of conversation create an electric yet intimate atmosphere.  

The main floor of the nightclub features a spacious dance floor encircled by VIP booths draped with heavy velvet curtains for privacy. A grand bar runs along one wall, its shelves stocked with both mortal liquors and discreetly concealed reserves of vitae for Kindred guests. An elevated DJ booth overlooks the floor, while state-of-the-art sound and lighting systems ensure the perfect ambiance for every gathering.  

Above the main level, a mezzanine provides a quieter space with private lounges, ideal for discreet conversations and Courtly dealings. Below ground, hidden behind a secure door, lies a series of private chambers reserved exclusively for Kindred use. These rooms serve as meeting spaces and secure havens for those who need them, ensuring that all Court members can use the Elysium without fear.  

Recently, The Crimson Veil gained its Keeper. The club remains a neutral ground for Kindred diplomacy and socialization, as well as  a hub of activity, where the lines between mortal and immortal blur under the pulsing lights and thundering bass.
