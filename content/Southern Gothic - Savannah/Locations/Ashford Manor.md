# Ashford Manor  
***Owner:*** [[William Ashford]]  
***Location:*** A sprawling plantation estate just outside Savannah, Georgia, surrounded by ancient live oaks draped in Spanish moss.  

***Description:***  
Ashford Manor is an imposing estate that exudes both grandeur and unease. Built in the early 18th century, the mansion is a testament to Savannah’s colonial history, with towering white columns, sprawling verandas, and meticulously maintained gardens. The live oaks that line the driveway seem to form a natural canopy, casting long shadows over the property and giving it an almost otherworldly air.  

The interior of the mansion is no less impressive, with high ceilings, polished hardwood floors, and rooms furnished with a blend of colonial antiques and modern luxuries. A grand staircase dominates the entrance hall, and the walls are adorned with portraits of Kindred and mortals who have served the Prince’s interests over the centuries.  

Ashford Manor serves as both the Prince’s private residence and a center of power for Savannah’s Court. The estate is equipped with hidden chambers and secure meeting rooms where the Prince conducts delicate negotiations and dispenses judgment. Beneath the house lies a vast network of tunnels and catacombs, used both for security and as a repository for the Prince’s many secrets.  

The atmosphere of Ashford Manor is one of quiet menace and absolute control, a reflection of its owner. Kindred who visit are acutely aware that they are in the presence of power, and any misstep on the estate grounds is met with swift consequences.
