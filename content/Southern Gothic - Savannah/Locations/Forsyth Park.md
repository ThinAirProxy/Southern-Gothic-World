***Description:***  
Forsyth Park, the verdant heart of the cityâ€™s historic district, unfurls beneath the sprawling boughs of ancient oaks, their gnarled limbs draped in ghostly veils of Spanish moss. By day, it is a picturesque sanctuary for mortals - lovers strolling beneath the gaslights, musicians weaving melodies into the humid air, the grand fountain casting its spray in timeless elegance. But beneath the surface, the park holds a different gravity at night, its manicured paths and open lawns transformed into a domain of quiet dominion. 

To those who understand the City's hidden currents, the park is not neutral ground. The Ventrue of Savannah, ever meticulous in their governance, permit none outside their clan to hunt within its bounds. To violate that claim here is to invite retribution, and the Ventrue do not simply punish; they make examples. 

And yet, Forsyth Park remains a place where the Kindred convene under the guise of civility. The pavilion, bathed in the glow of antique lanterns, hosts quiet negotiations and hushed conspiracies, exchanging words like barbed wire. The garden paths provide a discreet stage for whispered exchanges, a setting where old debts are settled and new alliances are forged beneath the cold light of the moon. The occasional night event is a big draw for all of Savannah to indulge in some entertainment under the stars, and for those restricted to the night forever to enjoy a manner of normalcy, even if it is only fleeting.
