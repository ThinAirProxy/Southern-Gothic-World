# The Belladonna  
***Owner:*** [[Daeva]] Clan (Primogen [[Alaric DuPont]] as primary steward)  
***Location:*** A luxurious riverboat docked on the Savannah River, near the heart of the city’s historic district.  

***Description:***  
The Belladonna is a grand, opulent riverboat that serves as the central gathering place for Savannah’s Daeva Family. Once a symbol of the Southern elite’s decadence, the riverboat has been meticulously restored to its former glory, blending vintage charm with modern extravagance. The boat’s exterior gleams under the moonlight, its elegant lines and intricately designed railings evoking the glamour of a bygone era.  

The interior is a study in indulgence, with polished wood paneling, plush velvet furniture, and golden chandeliers casting warm light over the space. The main deck features an expansive ballroom with a stage for live performances and a grand piano that Eleanor Langston herself often plays. The upper levels include private lounges and meeting rooms where Daeva matters are discussed, while the lower decks house private quarters and spaces for more clandestine activities.  

The Belladonna is not just a haven for the Daeva; it is also a symbol of their influence and style. The riverboat regularly hosts exclusive events, from lavish parties to intimate gatherings, serving as a neutral ground for negotiations and a showcase of the Daeva’s flair for beauty and charm. Despite its inviting atmosphere, the boat is heavily secured, and those who misstep quickly find themselves escorted to the edge of its gilded decks.  

The constant, gentle sway of the river and the soft hum of the boat’s engines create an almost hypnotic atmosphere, perfectly suited to the Daeva’s talents for allure and manipulation. For those who enter The Belladonna, it is easy to lose track of time—and harder still to resist its intoxicating spell.
