***Description:***
Nestled beneath the streets of downtown Savannah, The Fox & Feather cocktail lounge is a hidden gem steeped in the intrigue of its Prohibition-era origins. Tucked behind an unassuming brick fa√ßade, the entrance down a small alleyway is marked only by a wrought-iron fox emblem set into a narrow wooden door, with the required bouncer by the door as the only indicator a bar is even there at all. Descending the creaking steps, patrons are greeted by the faint hum of jazz and the warm, amber glow of vintage-style sconces to light the room. The interior retains much of its original charm: exposed brick walls, low arched ceilings, dark wooden beams, and a mosaic-tiled floor. Behind the mahogany bars manned by expert bartenders that will craft custom cocktails upon request, bottles of rare spirits line towering shelves set into alcoves that previously stored bootlegged barrels.

Copper fox figurines crouch along the shelves and in all sorts of hidden places to amuse patrons who find them, while delicate feather motifs are etched into the glasses. On the opposite side of the long bar are black leather booths snugly fit into the storage alcoves, offering privacy and a bit of secrecy if one required it. Scattered between the booths and the bar are low tables, comfortable seating and some high round tables used for casual leaning and standing conversation. The atmosphere is more subdued than most places, allowing for quiet conversation and intimate gatherings. 

 It's not an expensive experience - not unless you want it to be. The bar will serve normal drinks, they just might be a little disappointed.
