# Langston Hall  

***Owner:*** [[Ventrue]] Clan (Primogen [[Eleanor Langston]] as primary steward)  
***Location:*** A stately Georgian manor located in Savannah’s historic district, surrounded by wrought iron fences and immaculately maintained gardens.  

***Description:***  
Langston Hall is the epitome of refinement and power, a grand estate that serves as the central hub for the Ventrue Family in Savannah. Built in the early 19th century, the manor’s red brick façade, white columns, and perfectly symmetrical architecture evoke a sense of timeless authority. The estate is meticulously maintained, with its manicured gardens and fountains serving as a visual representation of the Ventrue’s dedication to order and control.  

Inside, the manor is an opulent blend of classical elegance and modern luxury. The grand entrance hall features a sweeping staircase, polished marble floors, and crystal chandeliers. Each room is furnished with exquisite antiques, fine art, and heirlooms that reflect the Ventrue’s storied history. A formal dining room serves as a gathering space for the Family, while the library holds a collection of rare books and financial ledgers, symbolizing their intellectual and economic power.  

Langston Hall also houses hidden meeting rooms and secure vaults where the Ventrue conduct their most sensitive affairs. The basement level includes a private wine cellar, repurposed to store vitae reserves and Kindred artifacts. While the estate is welcoming to allies, it is also heavily guarded, with modern security systems and loyal ghouls ensuring that the Ventrue’s sanctum remains impenetrable.  

Langston Hall is more than a residence—it is a symbol of the Ventrue’s dominance and legacy in Savannah. Every detail, from its flawless upkeep to its strategic location, reinforces the Family’s place at the pinnacle of Kindred society.
