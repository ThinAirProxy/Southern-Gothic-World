# The Arena

***Owner:*** [[Viktor Ivanov]]  
***Location:*** Downtown area  

***Description:***
Located in an abandoned warehouse, the Arena lies stripped of its original setup down to its bare basics now under new delegated management. Obstacles and archways litter the original high-ceiling factory floor with a small rise of an open ‘ring’, encouraging those here to hone their skills and adapt to new challenges. Above, a mezzanine floor wraps around it for spectators to watch - though those floors too are not off limits should a spar spill out into it. 

Once used for bloodsport between mortals and Kindred alike, this space has been taken over as a training ground on offer for fledglings to hone their skills and prepare themselves for threats to their Requiem. 

This is, obviously, not an Elysium, but it is certainly encouraged that should you fight here, you fight on agreed terms, and not to Final Death.
