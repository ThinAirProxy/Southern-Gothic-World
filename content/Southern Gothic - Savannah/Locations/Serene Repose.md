***Description:***  
Serene Repose is a tranquil sanctuary where Kindred can gather in peace and neutrality, upholding the sacred traditions of Elysium. The spa, housed in a beautifully restored bathhouse, combines the elegance of Victorian architecture with modern amenities, creating an atmosphere of timeless serenity. Its exterior is understated, with ivy-covered walls and soft lantern lighting, blending seamlessly into the historic neighborhood.  

Inside, the spa is a haven of calm and luxury. Gentle lighting and soothing aromas of lavender and sandalwood permeate the air. The central atrium features a large, heated indoor pool surrounded by marble pillars and cascading water features. Private rooms for meditation and reflection branch off from the main area, each uniquely designed with plush seating, calming decor, and soundproof walls to ensure privacy.  

A notable feature of Serene Repose is the Reflection Chamber, a mirrored room designed for deep introspection. The chamber’s walls are covered in polished glass that creates infinite reflections, symbolizing the eternal nature of Kindred existence. This space is often used for quiet contemplation or private conversations.  

The Keeper of Elysium, Serena Calloway, enforces the rules with quiet authority, ensuring that Serene Repose remains a neutral ground. All weapons must be surrendered at the entrance, and the use of Disciplines is strictly forbidden, a rule upheld by the Daeva attendants who oversee the spa’s operations.  

Serene Repose is more than a meeting place; it is a retreat from the chaos of Kindred politics, offering a rare opportunity for reflection, diplomacy, and rest in an otherwise turbulent existence.
