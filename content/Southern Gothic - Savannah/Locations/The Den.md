# The Den  
***Owner:*** [[Gangrel]] Clan (Primogen [[MeeMaw]] as matriarch)  
***Location:*** A secluded hunting cabin deep within the dense forests surrounding Savannah, accessible only via narrow, winding dirt roads.  

***Description:***  
The Den is a rustic and unassuming hunting cabin that serves as the heart of the Gangrel Family in Savannah. Tucked away in the wilderness, the estate is a stark contrast to the opulence of other Kindred havens. The cabin itself is modest in size, built from weathered wood and surrounded by a sprawling expanse of untamed forest. Despite its outward simplicity, The Den radiates a primal energy, a testament to its connection with the Gangrel and their feral roots.  

The interior of the cabin is practical and sparse, with heavy wooden furniture and walls adorned with trophies from hunts—antlers, pelts, and even claw marks etched into the beams. A large stone fireplace dominates the main room, where MeeMaw often holds court, her presence as much a part of the space as the crackling fire. The scent of pine and earth fills the air, and the sounds of the forest outside are a constant backdrop.  

Beyond the cabin, The Den’s true domain lies in the surrounding forest. The Gangrel Family uses the area for training, hunting, and conducting their rituals. Hidden paths lead to sacred groves, natural springs, and secret meeting places known only to the Family. The forest itself seems alive, protective of its Gangrel inhabitants, and hostile to outsiders who dare to trespass.  

The Den is a place of raw power and connection to the Beast, where the Gangrel gather to bond, train, and celebrate their primal heritage. Those invited into its sanctuary are treated as allies—but those who intrude without permission often find themselves hunted through the very woods that protect the Family.
