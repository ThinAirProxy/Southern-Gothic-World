# Sweetwater Café

***Owner:*** [[Dorothy Abernathy]]  
***Location:*** Historic District  

***Description:***
Nestled down a quiet, cobblestone street in Savannah, Sweetwater Café opens only after the sun sets, glowing warmly under twinkling string lights. Open only at night, it invites you into a world of Southern charm and heartfelt hospitality, offering soul-soothing comfort food that feels like home at an hour that can feel unfriendly to most.

The café’s wooden interior is a patchwork of character and history, with mismatched furniture that seems lovingly curated rather than random—each chair, table, and shelf tells its own story. Walls of warm, honey-toned wood are adorned with vintage photographs, handwritten recipes, and shelves filled with books and knickknacks, making the space feel like an extension of someone’s cherished living room.

Large doors and windows open out onto an exterior patio, where small, charming tables are tucked beneath strings of lights, letting the fresh night air mingle with the scent of pecan pie, fried chicken, and cornbread wafting from the kitchen.

Inside and out, the café often buzzes with laughter, quiet conversations, and the soft hum of soulful music playing in the background. Guests are greeted like old friends, and every detail, from the food to the décor, is designed to make you feel like family. Whether you’re savoring shrimp and grits or a slice of pie, Sweetwater Café offers more than just a meal; it’s an embrace of Savannah’s warm, welcoming spirit.

For Kindred, Dotty is more than happy to let any down on their luck earn an honest living at an hour that is more accommodating, even if it's just for one shift. While it's not an Elysium, it *is* bad manners to feed on the patrons, especially as it sits within the Abernathy sister's claimed Feeding Grounds. You wouldn't want to make poor Dotty upset, would you?
