# The Obsidian Mausoleum  
***Owner:*** [[Mekhet]] Clan (Primogen [[Marcus Devereaux]] as custodian)  
***Location:*** Bonaventure Cemetery, situated in a secluded, heavily shadowed section of Savannah’s iconic burial grounds.  

***Description:***  
The Obsidian Mausoleum is a grand, foreboding structure that serves as the central hub for the Mekhet Family in Savannah. Built of black granite, its imposing walls and gothic design make it stand out even among the ornate memorials of Bonaventure Cemetery. The mausoleum is shrouded in perpetual shadow, its entrance guarded by intricately carved statues of veiled figures that seem to watch all who approach.  

Inside, the mausoleum is both a sanctuary and a place of study. The main chamber is lit by flickering candlelight, with the air thick with the scent of aged wood and incense. Shelves carved directly into the stone walls hold ancient texts, scrolls, and artifacts collected by the Mekhet over the centuries. A central stone table serves as a meeting place for the Family, often used for quiet discussions or rituals that align with the Mekhet’s penchant for secrecy and enlightenment.  

Beneath the mausoleum lies a sprawling network of catacombs that extend deep into the earth. These tunnels house private quarters for the Family’s most trusted members, hidden chambers for study and experimentation, and secure vaults where the Mekhet safeguard their most valuable secrets. The tunnels are deliberately labyrinthine, ensuring that intruders are quickly lost and at the mercy of their hosts.  

The surrounding cemetery serves as an extension of the Mekhet’s domain. The carefully curated atmosphere of decay and quiet reverence is both a reflection of the Clan’s connection to death and a convenient tool for discouraging outsiders. To the Mekhet, The Obsidian Mausoleum is not just a home but a symbol of their unity, intellect, and dominion over the unseen.
