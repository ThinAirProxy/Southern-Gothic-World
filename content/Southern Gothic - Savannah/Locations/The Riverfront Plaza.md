***Description:***
Near [[The Crimson Veil]], The Riverfront Plaza is a place where [[Savannah]]'s pulse is alive with a gentle hum, a stretch of historic cobblestone and wrought-iron balconies that overlooks the dark, languid waters of the Savannah River. By day, it is a jewel of the city’s old-world charm, where tourists sip cocktails beneath gas lanterns and riverboats drift lazily past. But when the sun dips below the horizon, the Plaza transforms into something altogether different—something more alluring, more dangerous. Music spills from the open doors of clubs and lounges, laughter curls like smoke in the humid air.

This is the domain of the Daeva, and none forget it. The Plaza is a declared feeding ground, an opulent hunting ground where the most refined predators weave seamlessly into the revelry that spills out at night, either from other eateries or the Veil itself and into the charming parks and adorned waterfront walk. This is not a free-for-all. The Daeva hold dominion here, and they enforce their claim with a velvet-gloved grip that leaves no room for dispute.

Yet, beyond its lure as a feeding ground, the Riverfront Plaza remains one of the most vital social arenas in Savannah, and a chance for all to see where the night takes them.
