### **Visible Effects:**  
- **Giant:** Her sheer size makes her an **imposing presence**, even among Kindred. She is nearly impossible to ignore, towering over most in a room.  
- **Aura of Menace:** Due to her immense size and intense bearing, people are uncomfortable around her. **People instinctively react to her as if she were dangerous—even when she doesn’t intend to be.**

### **Description:**  
Samantha **"Sam"** Harrow is a **living fortress**—**broad-shouldered, thick-thighed, and built like she was meant for war.** Her green eyes **miss nothing**, always calculating, always **measuring the battlefield**—whether that battlefield is the **SCA**, an **accounting spreadsheet**, or a **room full of Kindred**.  

She is usually seen in **practical clothing**—nothing flashy, nothing excessive. **Jeans, boots, simple shirts, and a leather jacket**. She dresses like someone who **values function over form**, someone who has been in enough fights to know that **fashion won't save you when things turn ugly**.  

Her **pale skin and robust vitality** betray something **not quite normal** about her, though most can’t quite place what it is. When she moves, she moves with **deliberate control**, as if **she is always aware of her own strength and how easily she could break things—or people.**

### **Personality:**  
Sam is **reserved and pragmatic**, a woman of **few words but strong convictions**. She prefers **logic over emotion** and **action over talk**. She doesn’t like unnecessary **drama or chaos**, but she **thrives in controlled conflict**, whether that be in combat or in high-stakes negotiations.  

She is **intimidating without trying to be**—her size, her silence, her **constant observation of others**—all of it makes people uneasy. And Sam is **keenly aware of this**. She knows how to **use her presence to her advantage**.  

**Traits & Behaviors:**  
- **Fiercely Loyal:** Once she chooses **her people**, she will stand by them **without hesitation**. But loyalty must be **earned**, not freely given.  
- **Calculated & Strategic:** Whether she is fighting with a **sword and shield** or **navigating the Kindred world**, she is **always thinking ahead**. She **doesn’t act rashly**, and she **rarely loses her temper.**  
- **Slow to Trust, Even Slower to Forgive:** Betrayal isn’t something Sam **takes lightly**. Cross her once, and she **won’t forget it.**  

Sam is still **figuring out** what it means to be **a Ghoul**—the **power, the addiction, the bond to her Regnant**—but one thing is certain:  

**She refuses to be weak.**
