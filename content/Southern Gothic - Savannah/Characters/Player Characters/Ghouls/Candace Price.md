***Description:*** Candace has vibrant curly red hair and an equally brilliant smile, that is often reflected in her green eyes. While not exceptionally tall, she is not super short either, standing at around 5'5". The curvy woman's fair skin is lightly freckled and carries a youthful glow to it. Her cheeks often carry a hint of a blush to them. Candace looks to be around in her late twenties. Like her Regnant she seems to always be dressed for the occasion. However one may notice that if it is a casual situation she tends towards soft, comfortable clothes.

***Personality:*** She seems possessed of a sweet, kind smile, that radiates a genuine, trustworthiness about her. Candace has a bubbly, warmth to her. Underneath the soft squishiness is a strength to her, and sheâ€™s often ready to lend a shoulder to rest on, as well as an empathetic ear to those in need.
