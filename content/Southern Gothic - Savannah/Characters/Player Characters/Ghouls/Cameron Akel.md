***Description:***

Cameron is a friendly-looking volunteer firefighter. He appears of Southeast Asian origin but speaks with a local accent, suggesting he's lived most if not all of his life in the US. He dresses well, but doesn't seem familiar with the brands or labels.

***Personality:***

Cameron is the first to attempt to lighten the mood in a dark situation. He cringes at attempts to bully those with obviously lower status. He has a bit of an inferiority complex himself thanks to his life experience, but he's working on it.
