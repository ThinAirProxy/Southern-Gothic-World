***Visible Effects:*** Novus' skin is covered in surgical markings and scars, but **little appears to stop him**. His constant attempts at body modification have maximized his pain threshold, and it will likely take a lot to do slow him down.

***Description:*** While frequently found wearing his medical vest, Novus is an otherwise intimidating presence. Broad with a stocky frame, he gives the impression that not only will he make threats to pursue his goals, but he'll back them up with force. Novus will not hesitate to insert himself into physical altercations as necessary, but there's a bestial aggression that punctuates his actions. Outside of his work, he's frequently found wearing a light-weight jacket, t-shirt, and jeans that blend into the crowd.

***Personality:*** Novus is an example of practiced impatience. He doesn't tolerate fools, and will not hesitate to dive into the action when the opportunity presents itself. While he might appear unkempt at first, he's a driven perfectionist. Searching for the perfect way to improve himself beyond his baseline, and is willing to sacrifice his humanity in his pursuits. His time as a biohacker has made him spiral into addiction, pursuing the knowledge needed to push his physical frame beyond its limits.
