***Description:***
Ismaire is all-around an alluring figure. With short hair bleached and dyed myriad colors, a supple figure that comfortably pushes the boundaries of her tailor-fit garments, and a calculated but effortless stride, she immediately draws attention from anyone in line of sight. She is usually dressed in pretentiously bedraggled clothes and patchwork outfits meant to evoke the DIY scene. Ismaire speaks with a slight fry to her voice and with a playfully sarcastic tone that can be difficult to place.

***Personality:***
Ismaire is a manipulative, materialistic party girl infatuated with luxury.

# **Tragic Loss: Local Musician Ismaire Jackson Found Dead in Apparent Break-In**  

Savannah, GA – *March 3, 2025*  

 The local music and arts community is mourning the sudden and tragic loss of Ismaire Jackson, a musician and recent heir to the historic Lain Estate. Jackson, known for her role as bassist and lead vocalist in the indie punk band The Dead Eagles, was found dead at the Lain Estate following what authorities believe to be a break-in during an unexpected power outage in the area. She was described by those who knew her as a charismatic but troubled young woman, and her passing has sent shockwaves through Savannah’s artistic circles.  

Jackson, whose unexpected inheritance of the Lain Estate came through her late grandfather Hugo Mera—a former tech giant and founder of Teccomp, which was later folded into Microsoft in 1990—had only recently taken up residence in the grand home. The estate, which originally belonged to Delores Lain, a sixth-generation descendant of the Lain family renowned for their maritime trade empire from 1812 to 1962, became hers through her grandfather’s marriage to Delores in 1971. Despite her notable lineage, Jackson remained deeply rooted in Savannah’s underground music scene, often frequenting local venues and performing with The Dead Eagles.  

Authorities have yet to release further details surrounding her death, though early reports indicate that Jackson had previously reported multiple assaults and concerns for her safety in the weeks leading up to the incident. Whether these prior events are connected remains under investigation. Friends and loved ones have requested privacy during this difficult time.  

The Dead Eagles, a queer and female-led indie punk band, have been a fixture in Savannah’s live music scene, known for their electrifying performances and strong community ties. They frequently performed at local dives and venues throughout Savannah and occasionally travelled north to Atlanta to bring their sound to a wider audience.  

Beyond music, Jackson was also the driving force behind The Ivory Iris, a newly opened tea shop in the Riverfront district. The shop, envisioned as a safe refuge for Savannah’s artistic and alternative communities, had only opened its doors last week. While speculation mounts over its future ownership, many hope that its continued existence will serve as a lasting tribute to Jackson’s vision—one where safe spaces at night might help prevent another tragedy such as this.  

As the investigation continues, Savannah mourns a vibrant young artist whose talent and spirit left an indelible mark on the city. Those who knew her best hope that her memory will live on through her music, her community, and the spaces she sought to create for others.  

Savannah PD encourage any with potential leads to come forward.
