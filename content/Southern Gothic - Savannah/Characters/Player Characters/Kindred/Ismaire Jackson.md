***Description:***
Ismaire is all-around an alluring figure. With short hair bleached and dyed myriad colors, a supple figure that comfortably pushes the boundaries of her tailor-fit garments, and a calculated but effortless stride, she immediately draws attention from anyone in line of sight. She is usually dressed in pretentiously bedraggled clothes and patchwork outfits meant to evoke the DIY scene. Ismaire speaks with a slight fry to her voice and with a playfully sarcastic tone that can be difficult to place.


***Personality:***
Ismaire is a manipulative, materialistic party girl infatuated with luxury.
