***Description:***
Delaney exudes a raw, rebellious charisma that’s impossible to ignore, even if her default expression—a classic resting bitch face—aims to keep others at a distance. Her piercing pale blue eyes, framed by wavy, dark brown hair, carry an intensity that can be either captivating or intimidating. Her fair skin contrasts with her punk-inspired wardrobe—worn leather jackets, ripped jeans, and thrift-store finds—which she wears with effortless confidence. Whether she’s lounging at a dive bar or performing at an underground poetry slam, Delaney’s presence is magnetic, carrying an air of both chaos and control. 

***Personality:***
Delaney is fiercely independent and unapologetically defiant, with a sharp wit and a penchant for rebellion. Beneath her tough exterior lies a deep well of creativity and vulnerability, which she channels into her poetry and zines. She connects deeply with outcasts and misfits, though her volatile temper and fear of vulnerability often sabotage her closest relationships. Delaney thrives in chaos, finding beauty in life’s raw and unpolished moments, but her self-destructive tendencies and mistrust of authority keep her teetering on the edge of self-discovery and collapse. Despite her struggles, Delaney’s fiery determination and refusal to conform make her an unforgettable force in Savannah’s Kindred society.

## Roleplay Hooks:
>The following may not be known IC, but can be used to help determine what our characters have in common or for setting a scene.

**Poetry and Provocation:** Delaney is a regular at Savannah’s underground literary scene, performing at poetry slams and publishing zines filled with raw, unfiltered work. If your character is a writer, artist, or just drawn to rebellious creativity, they might cross paths with her at a reading—or become the subject of one of her scathing verses.

**The Firebrand:** Delaney believes in the Carthian Movement, but she’s no politician. She fights for what she believes in, sometimes literally. If your character is involved in Carthian politics, needs a fighter on their side, or wants to challenge her ideals, she’s ready for a debate—or a brawl.

**Too Close for Comfort:** Delaney pushes people away before they can get too close, but some people refuse to stay at a distance. If your character is determined to break through her defenses—whether as a friend, an ally, or something more—they’ll have their work cut out for them.

**Sorrow’s Siren:** There’s something magnetic about Delaney, something that draws in the lost and broken. If your character is struggling with grief, self-doubt, or past failures, they might find themselves unable to look away from her—or worse, drawn to confess their darkest thoughts to the last person they should trust.
