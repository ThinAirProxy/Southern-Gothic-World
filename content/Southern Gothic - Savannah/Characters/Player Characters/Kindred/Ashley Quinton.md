***Description:***
Ashley Quinton is a small and slight figure, standing at just 5'4", but he carries himself with a quiet confidence that makes him hard to overlook. His dyed blonde hair is kept intentionally messy, with dark brown roots peeking through, giving him an effortlessly cool look. His piercing blue eyes seem to notice everything, and his pale skin, smooth and luminous, is marked with subtle tattoos on his arms and wrists, hinting at a rebellious streak.

Ashley's wardrobe is unapologetically gender non-conforming. He seamlessly blends masculine and feminine pieces, often pairing sharp blazers with flowing skirts or oversized jackets with delicate lace tops. Combat boots, stockings, and bold accessories round out his style, reflecting his unique blend of punk and gothic influences.

One of Ashley's most striking features is his nails. Thick and sharp, they’ve been reinforced with layers of resin, turning them into claw-like extensions that are both stylish and a little intimidating. Whether he's dressed for a night out or simply strolling through Savannah's streets, Ashley’s look feels deliberate and modern, with a touch of edge that leaves a lasting impression.


***Personality:***

Ashley Quinton comes across as bold and confident, the kind of person who can draw people in with a smile and a clever remark. He’s charming and self-assured, always ready with a story or a joke, and he carries himself like there’s nothing he can’t handle. People are naturally drawn to him, and he knows how to keep their attention.

Underneath that polished exterior, though, there’s a more cutting side to Ashley. He has a quiet enjoyment of watching others struggle or fail, even if he keeps it to himself. While he presents himself as someone who has it all together, his confidence often masks a need to stay on top, even if it’s at the expense of someone else.
