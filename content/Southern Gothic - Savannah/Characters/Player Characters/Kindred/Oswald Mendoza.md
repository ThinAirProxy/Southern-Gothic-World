***Description:***
Oswald Mendoza is your typical gross gamer guy, repulsive to be around even before being embraced by Clan Nosferatu. He doesn't wash, rarely goes outside (he's developing drones so he doesn't even need to do that anymore.)

He was shut in before, feeding himself with Uber Eats and DoorDash funded by credit card fraud, and honestly not much has changed, except now the driver is the meal. 

***Personality:***
Oswald is the worst person you've ever met online, to the point where you might wonder if people like this even exist in the real world. The worst part is he's exceptionally talented in his area of expertise, so sometimes you might be relucantly forced to interact with him. Don't worry, he hates it just as much as you.

**Roleplay Hooks:**
	The following are some Out-of-Character suggestions/excuses  for our characters to interact.

**The Shattered Refuge:** If your character is ever a guest of the Nosferatu at the Shattered Refuge Ozzy has the ability and inclination to make himself a part of that interaction. 

**Adversary:** If you'd like a scene where your character is in conflict with another, either mechanically or ideologically, Ozzy is contrarian to a fault and I'm down to play him as a foil to anyone.

**Surveillance & Security:** Got a job that requires monitoring of a person or location? Planning a heist? Ozzy's the guy in the van will all the camera feeds talking into your earpiece.

**Internet Troll:** I can have him pick on you for fun if that's what you're into.

**Politically Subversive:** He talks a lot of shit about people in power, maybe your character has taken offense one of his jabs and wants to take him down a peg? Maybe he's seen as an actual threat? Better check him out just in case.

**Locations:** The Shattered Refuge, Nosferatu Territory, The Waffle House, The Nexus, or push one of the red buttons about town and he may contact you.
