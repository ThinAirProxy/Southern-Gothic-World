***Description:*** Rhett is a man who appears to be in his late 20s. His brown hair is only starting to grow out of the military cut from his time in the service. His eyes are a dark gray color that have a piercing color to them. He's kept himself in shape from his military days so he has quite the athletic build to him. He dresses casually and comfortably, though he can spruce up rather nicely if the occasion comes to it.

***Personality:*** Rhett comes off as a fairly cheerful individual. Generally laid back and welcoming he is easy to smile and quick to share a joke. One might assume that he is just a carefree ship on the water at first glance. But his eyes hide an intensity that lurks beneath the surface and he is more the willing to get serious when the occasion calls for it.
