***Visible Effects:*** There’s something about her face, perhaps it was the upbringing, the things fate instill in you, or simply the hard life of someone used to deflect violence at home. Whichever the origin, Virgo knows how to get under people’s skins and break them away from whatever they were thinking ( Striking Looks: Disarming)


***Description:*** Virgo is a lean, tallish woman with short hair, although she has a tendency to buzz it just to watch it grow back again the other night. She’s pretty in the way something broken is pretty, there is a desperation that lingers in her face at most times, like she is always looking for the exit, trying to find a way out. That energy permeates most of what she does, and she rarely smiles now, although a scowl has been threatening to become a permanent fixture. Living on the streets, the shame of Darius Cole, she rejected the Lancea, and has been trying to get her bearings — and failing. It’s been a little more than a month, but her Requiem clearly left it’s mark on her.

***Personality:*** Virgo is lost, she doesn’t know who she is or what her purpose is anymore, and that makes her both vulnerable and dangerous. The teachings of her religious life and the intense need for blood and survival can be seen warring inside her; it’s not difficult to read her, although she’s not exactly an open book either. She might help you one second and snap on the next, it’s clear she hates what she was made into, she hates the god that betrayed her, and she’s very close to hating everything in the world because of it. Still she’s much too afraid of the end, of dying alone, and of what awaits her soul when it all comes crashing down.
