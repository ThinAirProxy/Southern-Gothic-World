***Description:*** 
A sleight woman, standing at 5 foot 10 inches.  She keeps her fading white blonde hair back in a short ponytail, where it often sneaks loose in waves.  Wearing expensive clothing that lends towards darker colors and comfort and utility over style.

***Personality:***
Ione, or Krueger as her colleagues refer to her, is a quiet woman who prefers to retain as much privacy as possible.  The daughter of Sheriff Angelica Krueger (who died of complicated circumstances just shy of 10 years ago), she was raised with a tight lip and a sharp eye.  Despite her intention to head into medicine, the life of the law pulled her back in.  

While she’s present and active within the community, she keeps her personal life under lock and key.  She’s curious and intelligent, hardworking and committed to her role.  Soft spoken, but a rock under pressure.
