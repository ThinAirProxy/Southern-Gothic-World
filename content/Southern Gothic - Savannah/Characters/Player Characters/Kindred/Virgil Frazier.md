***Description:***
Virgil’s sense of style is smart but functional. He likes to present himself well, and isn't one for being overly flashy. Most days he’ll be found in a well-fitted suit in either charcoal or navy, and if you were to go through old photos, you’d notice it’s the same suits he’s been wearing for years. He never throws out anything that still has some use left.

His voice is warm and smooth, and he speaks like someone who’s never had to raise his voice to get what he wants. There’s an unmistakable Southern lilt, but it’s softened, refined by years of working with high-profile clients. 

***Personality:***
Virgil Frazier is the kind of man who can walk into any room and make himself at home. He’s warm without being overeager, polished but not pretentious, carrying himself with the confidence of a man who knows how to read a room and can adjust accordingly. 

He prefers honey over vinegar - a firm handshake, a well-placed joke, a knowing look that says *I understand you better than you think*. Virgil is calculated but affable, a man who prefers to win people over rather than strong-arm them. He’s the guy who offers you a drink before getting to business, the one who makes a problem sound smaller just by talking about it. He believes in getting what he wants through connection, persuasion, and patience, rather than brute force. 

But make no mistake - when clever words won’t cut it, he knows exactly how to handle himself.
