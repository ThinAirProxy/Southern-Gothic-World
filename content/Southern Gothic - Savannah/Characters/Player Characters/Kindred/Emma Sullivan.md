Description: Most people know of Emma is that she is a shy and introverted individual, often preferring the company of her computer screens over social interactions. However most will ever only know her by her Alias "Echo" among the dark web, via various websites and post boards. she has a natural talent for computers. She could hack into systems and manipulate data like a maestro conducting a symphony, Echo found herself ensnared in a world of petty crime and dangerous connections. She mastered the art of pickpocketing, lock picking, and theft, learning how to move unnoticed and leave no trace behind. Her quick thinking and nimble fingers made her indispensable, but also a target for those who craved her skills, potentially what lead to her embrace.

Personality: Upon first impressions, Echo is skiddish as a mouse, very flinchy, and seems to suffer social anxiety. She will make jokes out of things to try and break tension even when they are not appropriate. most never see her more than a shy and delicate woman, but those who know her more personally or during a job find a completely different side of her, when she's doing anything she's specialized in, you will find her to be hyper focused, confident, and maybe even overzealous as she works as if in an effort to impress you.
