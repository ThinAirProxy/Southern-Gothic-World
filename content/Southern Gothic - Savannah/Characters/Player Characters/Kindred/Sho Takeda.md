***Description:*** Sho Takeda is a brute wrapped in a thin veneer of refinement, a man whose sheer physicality demands attention. His broad, muscular frame strains against the tailored lines of his pinstripe suit, giving him the look of a predator playing at civility. His face is rugged and scarred, his nose slightly crooked from an old break, and his heavy brow lends a permanent shadow to his sharp, calculating eyes.

There’s nothing delicate about Sho—his hands are thick, scarred, and calloused, the kind that look more suited to breaking bones than signing deals. His blood-red shirt, open at the collar, adds a splash of boldness to an otherwise utilitarian look. When Sho speaks, his voice carries the weight of someone who knows he doesn’t need to explain himself twice, a man as comfortable dealing with problems at a boardroom table as he is crushing them with his fists.

***Personality:*** Sho Takeda is a man driven by strength, loyalty, and pragmatism. He operates with a straightforward philosophy: respect is earned, weakness is despised, and problems are solved directly. Blunt and brutally honest, he has little time for posturing or flowery words, preferring to cut straight to the point in every interaction. His loyalty to those he trusts is unwavering, and he views betrayal as the ultimate sin—an act he repays swiftly, often with violence.
