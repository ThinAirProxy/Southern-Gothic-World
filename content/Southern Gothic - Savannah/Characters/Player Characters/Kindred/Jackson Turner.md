***Description:***
Jackson seems to hold a rugged charm and commanding presence. He's possessed of a strong jawline, piercing blue eyes, and short, often slightly tousled brown hair. He carries himself with confidence and intensity, and is rarely without one of his hounds at his side.

***Personality:***
Jackson blends his forceful presence with an aura of affable sophistication that belies the rough upbringing of his youth. Behind his friendly smile is a cold, analytical mind that weighs nearly every interaction in terms of leverage and gain. His passion for breeding hounds meant for ghouling is more than a businessâ€”it's a testament to his belief in power through control, an eerie reflection of his meticulous and relentless nature.
