***Description:*** Plain, boring, just another dumb country yokel. That’s how people outside of Savanna would describe Jacob, anyway. They aren’t even entirely wrong, if you just look at the boots, jeans, and rough looking flannels, or hear the twang in his voice. As with most things, there’s a lot more under the surface. Under the surface, there’s loyalty, there’s devotion, there’s the frightening determination of someone with something to prove, and there’s the quiet, violent longing of someone who wants to be free from expectation, both imposed by others and by himself. 

Jacob was on a fast track to everything everyone else wanted for him: passable grades at a good university, an incredible scholarship afforded by his prodigious wrestling ability. And Jacob was contently convinced that he wanted it too. Why wouldn’t he? He was quite content, up until the moment he met his Sire. Jacob can’t claim to have known what exactly they were going on about. Rebellion, change, idealism… freedom; but it resonated with him. The idea that he could do more with himself and his skills, that he could choose. . . that he could be free. Jacob didn’t look back, even when Riley sank their fangs in his neck and dragged him along into the Danse Macabre.
