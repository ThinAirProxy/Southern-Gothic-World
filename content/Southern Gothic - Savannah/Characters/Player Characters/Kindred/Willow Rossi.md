***Description:***
Willow Rossi appears to be a well-fed, physically competent person who kept a balanced diet in life. She stands a hair above average height, brown eyes fiery and judgemental. Willow has no problem with speaking their mind, and will do whatever it takes to plant their values in the psyche of anyone nearby. Most of their wardrobe is plain and dark, opting for dark corduroy jackets and deep blue denim paired with either laced-up combat boots or laceless running shoes.  In life, she could be found bartending and bouncing around Savannah's dive bar scene when she was not performing with her band.


***Personality:***
Willow is an inflexible firebrand, willing to burn any bridge to anyone if they wrong her in any way. Their sophisticated worldview is too complicated to explain to anyone who hasn't read Marxist theory, and they don't have the time or patience to spoon-feed centrist liberals. The internet is free, google it. While she does destroy her relationships wantonly, Willow is said to be a deeply caring and passionate person by the few folks who have managed to stay her friends.
