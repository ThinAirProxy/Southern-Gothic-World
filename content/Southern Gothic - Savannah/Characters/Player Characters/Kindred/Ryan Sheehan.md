***Description:***
Ryan carries himself with a quiet confidence and an easy smile. His sturdy frame and rough hands speak to a life of physical labor but the sharpness in his blue eyes doesn't lend that to that being the whole story. He's usually in simple, practical clothes that may or may not have car grease stains. 

***Personality:***
Loyal to a fault and very pragmatic, Ryan will stand up for those that need to be stood up for. He has a quiet charisma that doesn't draw attention unless he wants it to. He's easy to get along with, until you give him a reason not to be.
