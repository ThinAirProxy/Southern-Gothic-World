***Description:*** 
Dotty is a demure figure rather than an imposing one, standing at a slightly short height and petite build, sometimes wearing old fashioned dresses that were her mommas, and her momma's too. Her black hair is often in a large mane of curls, opting only for wigs when she feels like it. She's got the kind of face that disarms most, and a smile that radiates joy. It's hard to believe sometimes that this woman needs blood to survive, and sometimes people give it up so willingly. 

***Personality:***
Dotty is the sweet southern belle that is almost sickly sweet at times. She laughs and she smiles at everything, and even in Undeath her eyes have a sparkle of life to them that hasn't faded away. Don't let the sweetness fool you though, she's just as quick to remind someone of their manners lest they forget them.

Running the [[Sweetwater Café]], her kind heart opens her doors to Kindred who need a place to feel human from time to time, or even earn some honest pay. Provided they mind their manners around the patrons, of course.

## Roleplay Hooks:
-# The following may not be known IC, but can be used to help determine what our characters have in common or for setting a scene.

**Bless Your Heart:** Dotty's just got that look about her as someone you can talk to. Don't mistake her softness though for coddling, she will be equally quick to tell you when you're drowning and you need to start to paddlin'.

**Brilliant Mind:** Despite all appearances, Dotty's a sharp tool in anyone's toolkit. She's an asset to a team, can open her sight to arcane influences and can easily sift through leads to know the right one to follow. 

**Humanity Advocate:** As an Erzebet, Dotty's as close to a human as Kindred can get. She always appears alive, and the warmth in her eyes hasn't yet faded. If you're looking for someone to just indulge in something *normal*, she's your woman.

**Home-Baked Goods:** Dotty owns and runs the Sweetwater Cafe. She's always open to having a chat when its quiet, offering down on their luck Kindred a job that suits their hours, and maybe even providing food for something that needs it free of charge!
