***Description:*** 
Short and slight, dressed simply in garments with muted colors and interesting textures, Mara could go unnoticed in most rooms, and might prefer it that way. Like her Sire, she manifests the Nosferatu curse in her unnervingly slim frame and empty, milky-white eyes. But, where Serena’s are motionless, Mara’s seem to follow others eerily wherever they are in the room, her sightless gaze seeming to peer through carefully-crafted facades at the secrets and fears concealed beneath.

***Personality:*** 
Mara is a quiet, introspective soul, with a mind sharpened by the necessity of perceiving the world through sound, touch, and intuition. She channels the alienation of the Nosferatu curse into hauntingly compelling poetry that serves as both refuge and weapon. Beneath her reserved exterior lies a fierce independence, and surprising empathy for a blood-sucking creature of the night.
