***Description:*** Sebastian Delacroix, known fondly as ‘Basti’ among his more familiar clients, is the picture of understated elegance. His lithe frame is perpetually clad in meticulously tailored suits, favoring dark tones offset by subtle pops of color—an amethyst pocket square, a crimson silk tie, or a lapel pin shaped like a raven. His pale skin, a side effect of his ghoul condition, enhances his aristocratic bone structure, while his dark eyes carry the quiet intensity of someone who observes more than he reveals. His jet-black hair is always impeccably styled, and his hands, though scarred by countless hours of crafting, are as steady as they are skilled.

***Personality:*** Basti exudes a calm, almost hypnotic charm, a trait honed through years of servitude and survival in the treacherous circles of the All Night Society. He is polite to a fault, with a voice like warm velvet, measured and soothing, no matter the chaos around him. However, beneath his courteous demeanor lies a sharp mind, a dry wit, and a resolve forged in shadows. Basti has a knack for making his clients feel understood and at ease, drawing out their preferences with unerring precision.

Sebastian’s skill as a tailor borders on the supernatural. His ability to understand fabric, form, and function feels more intuitive than learned—a likely benefit of the vitae he receives from his patron. He specializes in crafting garments that merge functionality with high fashion, incorporating hidden elements such as armored linings, pockets for concealed weapons, or enchantments for supernatural purposes. His knowledge of vampiric traditions and aesthetics is encyclopedic, ensuring his creations always meet the nuanced expectations of his clientele.

Basti is also a gifted listener. His shop serves as a neutral ground where the whispers of the All Night Society converge. Over the years, he has become a repository of secrets, knowing when to speak, when to listen, and—most importantly—when to forget.
