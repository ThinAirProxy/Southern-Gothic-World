***Personality:***  
Calliope Rivers is a deeply spiritual figure with an aura of mystery and power, embodying the eerie, otherworldly nature of the Wickers bloodline. As a representative of the Circle of the Crone, she blends ancient rites with her bloodline’s darker, more unsettling practices, drawing strength from her connection to the supernatural and the spirits of the land. She is passionate, articulate, and unwavering in her devotion to the Crone, serving as both guide and guardian for her Covenant.  

While Calliope often projects warmth and wisdom, she carries an undercurrent of unsettling energy, a reminder of the darker forces she wields. She is unafraid to confront the Court’s traditions when they clash with the Circle’s teachings, and her unwavering faith has earned her both respect and fear within the Kindred society.  

***Description:***  
Calliope is a striking Hispanic woman with an ethereal beauty that is almost disconcerting. Her caramel-toned skin glows faintly under moonlight, and her long, dark hair falls in loose waves adorned with small charms and braided threads. Her deep brown eyes have a piercing intensity, capable of both soothing and unnerving those who meet her gaze.  

Her attire is an eclectic mix of traditional and ritualistic, often wearing flowing skirts, embroidered blouses, and shawls in muted, earthy tones. Her presence is accented by subtle, eerie details—amulets of twisted silver, necklaces of bone and stone, and rings etched with sigils—that hint at her bloodline’s occult nature. Calliope is rarely seen without her ritual dagger, its blade inscribed with symbols of protection and power.
