***Personality:***  
Dr. Hana Takamura is a composed and enigmatic figure, deeply dedicated to the Ordo Dracul’s pursuit of transcendence. Born in Japan during the Meiji period, Hana witnessed a world rapidly shifting between tradition and modernity, shaping her duality of thought: reverence for the past and an unrelenting drive toward innovation. Her Dragolescu bloodline strengthens her connection to the supernatural, granting her an unshakable focus on uncovering the mysteries of the Curse.  

Hana’s demeanor is disciplined and precise. She rarely shows emotion, preferring to wield logic, knowledge, and the power of silence as her greatest tools. Her leadership style is methodical, and she demands the same level of rigor from those around her. Though her aloof nature can make her seem distant, her sharp intellect and unerring focus command respect.  

***Description:***  
Hana is a striking woman with light olive-toned skin that reflects her timeless beauty. Her jet-black hair is usually styled in a sleek bun or falls straight to her shoulders, always immaculately groomed. Her almond-shaped dark brown eyes are sharp and calculating, often giving the impression that she is always two steps ahead. Her features are delicate yet carry a severity that underscores her disciplined nature.  

Her attire is understated yet elegant, favoring tailored suits and high-collared dresses in muted tones of gray, black, and deep red. She wears minimal jewelry, save for a silver dragon-shaped pendant, a symbol of her allegiance to the Ordo Dracul. Her presence is marked by a calm intensity, and those around her often feel the weight of her expectations.
