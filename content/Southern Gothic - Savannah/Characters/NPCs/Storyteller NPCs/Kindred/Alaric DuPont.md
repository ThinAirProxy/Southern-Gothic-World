***Personality:***  
Alaric DuPont is the embodiment of Invictus ideals: charismatic, cunning, and ruthlessly efficient. As a member of the Spina bloodline, Alaric pairs the Daeva’s natural allure with an unrelenting focus on perfection, both in himself and in those around him. He is a master of courtly decorum and political maneuvering, always seeming to be one step ahead of his rivals.  

Though outwardly charming and composed, Alaric is a strict traditionalist, believing in the absolute authority of the First Estate and the importance of hierarchy. He sees himself as a steward of Invictus ideals, tasked with preserving its legacy and ensuring its dominance within Savannah’s Court. Alaric can be merciless to those who fail to meet his standards, but his loyalty to the Covenant and its members is unquestionable.  

***Description:***  
Alaric is a striking dark-skinned man with sharp, aristocratic features and a commanding presence. His short, wavy black hair is always immaculately groomed, adding to his refined and polished appearance. His piercing blue eyes stand out against his rich complexion, lending him an almost supernatural intensity that captivates and unsettles in equal measure.  

His wardrobe is impeccable, favoring tailored suits and silk ties in classic colors like black, navy, and deep burgundy. Every detail of his appearance is meticulously curated, from his polished shoes to the cufflinks bearing the insignia of the Invictus. Alaric’s demeanor exudes control, and his movements are measured and deliberate, leaving an impression of quiet, predatory grace.
