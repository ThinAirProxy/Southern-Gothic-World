***Personality:***  
Isabella is calm, enigmatic, and deeply spiritual, with a quiet intensity that makes her presence in a room impossible to ignore. A necromancer by trade and faith, she holds death in reverence, seeing it as both a tool and a guide. Her words are deliberate, often poetic, and she has a knack for unsettling others with her unblinking stare and cryptic insights. Isabella is fiercely protective of her Family and the secrets of the dead, and she views the Court’s politics as a necessary inconvenience, albeit one she navigates with surgical precision.  

***Description:***  
Isabella is a strikingly beautiful dark-skinned Black woman with sharp features that convey wisdom and poise. She wears her hair in tight, intricate braids that reflect her meticulous nature, often adorned with subtle beads or charms that carry personal or mystical significance. Her wardrobe is a blend of mourning attire and elegance, favoring flowing dresses in deep blacks and muted purples that evoke both respect and mystery.  

Her eyes seem to hold secrets as old as the grave itself, and when channeling her necromantic powers, they take on a faint, spectral glow. Her presence commands both reverence and unease, a fitting reflection of her mastery over death. Isabella resides in a mausoleum within Bonaventure Cemetery, where she tends the graves of the dead and communes with the spirits, including her husband, [[Elijah]]—a ghost bound to her through necromantic rites.
