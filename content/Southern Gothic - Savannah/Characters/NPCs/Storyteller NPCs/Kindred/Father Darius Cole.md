***Personality:***  
Father Darius Cole is a stern and uncompromising figure, embodying the unyielding authority of the Lancea et Sanctum. His Embrace and bloodline have only reinforced his belief that Kindred existence is a test of faith, and he holds himself and others to the highest moral standards. Darius has little patience for weakness or hypocrisy, demanding absolute devotion to the teachings of Longinus and the mission of the Sanctified.  

His sermons are fire and brimstone, delivered with a fierce passion that leaves no room for doubt or dissent. While he is pragmatic in political matters, he views his Covenant’s role in the Court as a divine mandate to steer the Kindred toward redemption—or enforce judgment upon them.  

***Description:***  
Darius is a light tan-skinned man with a stern, imposing presence. His slightly overweight frame and sharp, angular features give him the air of an unyielding judge rather than a comforting preacher. His short-cropped hair, graying at the temples, lends him an aura of gravitas and authority.  

His piercing black eyes gleam with an intensity that unnerves those who meet his gaze, as if he sees through their masks to the sins beneath. Darius dresses in severe black cassocks or tailored suits with clerical collars, always immaculate and designed to emphasize his role as a spiritual enforcer. His movements are deliberate and controlled, every step and gesture exuding purpose and strength.
