***Personality:***  
Gideon Black is a towering enforcer and the Prince’s most loyal Hound, embodying raw strength and unyielding resolve. His presence is both intimidating and awe-inspiring, as his massive frame and deliberate demeanor leave little doubt about his role as the Prince’s chosen weapon. While his appearance inspires fear, Gideon operates with a strict sense of duty, wielding his power to maintain order and uphold the Prince’s decrees.  

Despite his terrifying visage, Gideon’s sense of fairness and loyalty make him more than a brute. He is deliberate in his actions and prefers to avoid unnecessary violence, though when provoked, his strength and ferocity are unmatched.  

***Description:***  
Gideon is a giant of a man, standing well over seven feet tall with a muscular frame that seems almost too large for his clothes. His Nosferatu curse is evident in his pale, cracked skin, which looks as though it has been stretched too tightly over his massive form. His eyes are bloody orbs that glow faintly, exuding an unsettling menace. He hides them behind dark sunglasses, both to conceal his curse and to make his appearance slightly less overwhelming.  

He dresses in durable, practical clothing, often a long leather coat that stretches over his massive shoulders, heavy combat boots, and fingerless gloves that reveal his broad, claw-like hands. A belt adorned with weapons and tools completes his utilitarian look, reinforcing the image of a hunter always ready for the next task.
