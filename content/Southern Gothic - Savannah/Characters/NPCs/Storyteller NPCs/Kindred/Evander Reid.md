***Visible Effects:***

***Description:***
Evan has a lean, angular build with sharp features and short, unkempt dark brown hair. His hazel eyes remain constantly alert, flicking between faces and exits with quiet calculation. Despite efforts to dress casually—button-downs in muted tones, cardigans, and worn jeans—he rarely manages to fully conceal the deep, blackened scarring that stretches across his collarbone and up one side of his neck. Sleeves are often rolled down now, even in warmer weather, and he moves with a cautious tension that betrays his history.

He still wears his rectangular glasses and favors clothing with utility over flair, but his once-relaxed posture has stiffened. There’s something haunted about his presence now—like a man who’s been listening too long for footsteps that never come. Even when seated, he chooses corners and angles with clear lines of sight and multiple escape routes.

***Personality:***
Once affable and disarmingly self-effacing, Evan now speaks with a noticeable edge of restraint and wariness. His trauma has carved deep grooves into his psyche, and it manifests in frequent nervous tics: tapping fingers, shifting eyes, biting his lower lip. He no longer laughs as freely and tends to second-guess the intentions behind even friendly gestures.

Though still intellectually sharp and politically savvy, Evan finds it harder to trust others—even among his own clan or covenant. He maintains a deep loyalty to the Carthian ideal of egalitarianism, but he now holds a quieter skepticism toward all authority. Beneath the damage, however, remains a fiercely determined survivor—one who has paid dearly to keep his ideals and unlife intact.
