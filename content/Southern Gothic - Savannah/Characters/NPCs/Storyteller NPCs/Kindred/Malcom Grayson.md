***Personality:***  
Malcolm Grayson is a steadfast enforcer of the Prince’s laws, embodying the protective and vigilant traits of the Shepard bloodline. His role as Sheriff perfectly complements his natural instincts to safeguard the Court and its members. While deeply loyal to the Prince, Mal’s focus is always on the collective well-being of Savannah’s Kindred, ensuring that justice is served with balance and fairness.  

As a Shepard, Mal exudes a quiet intensity and a sense of watchfulness. He is known for his patience and willingness to give Kindred a chance to explain themselves, but he acts decisively when the situation calls for it. His no-nonsense demeanor and firm moral compass make him both respected and feared in equal measure.  

***Description:***  
Mal is a ruggedly handsome man with sun-weathered tan skin, sharp features, and a strong, sturdy build that reflects his Gangrel heritage. His short, dark brown hair is peppered with gray, and his beard is neatly trimmed. His piercing green eyes seem to see straight through deception, a trait heightened by his Shepard lineage.  

Mal dresses practically, favoring leather jackets, durable boots, and workmanlike clothing when in the field. During formal Court functions, he opts for a tailored yet understated suit, though his discomfort with such attire is evident. A silver chain bracelet engraved with the Shepard bloodline sigil and the insignia of the Invictus serves as his only ornamentation, symbolizing his dual loyalties.
