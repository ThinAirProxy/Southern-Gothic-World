***Personality:***  
Viktor Ivanov is an imposing figure, both physically and ideologically. A staunch believer in equality and communal strength, he embodies the revolutionary ideals of the Carthian Movement with the discipline of a soldier and the zeal of a true believer. Once a Soviet spy during the height of the Red Scare, Viktor brings a strategic mind and unyielding determination to his work within the Court.  

Though his loyalty to the Carthian Movement is absolute, Viktor maintains a pragmatic approach to politics, understanding that diplomacy and compromise are often necessary tools to achieve lasting change. He carries himself with a quiet intensity, his presence alone enough to command a room. While Viktor is a man of action, he is also deeply introspective, grappling with the contradictions of his existence as a predator fighting for the oppressed.  

***Description:***  
Viktor is a towering, muscular figure, his broad shoulders and solid frame radiating physical power. His square jaw and piercing blue eyes give him a striking, almost statuesque presence. He shaves his head completely bald, a choice that enhances his imposing demeanor and draws attention to his strong, angular features. Viktor keeps his neatly trimmed beard, which is flecked with silver, adding a sense of wisdom and experience to his formidable appearance.  

His style is utilitarian yet formal, often wearing dark suits with understated red accentsâ€”a subtle nod to his ideological roots. When in less formal settings, Viktor favors military-inspired clothing, such as combat boots and tailored coats, blending practicality with his larger-than-life persona.****
