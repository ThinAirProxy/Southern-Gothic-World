***Personality:***  
Evan Reid is a clever and resourceful Kindred who serves as a bridge between factions in Savannah’s Court. As a Lynx Mekhet, his innate perceptiveness and knack for uncovering hidden truths make him an effective and trusted Emissary. Evan is fiercely independent but sees the Carthian Movement as a means to push for a more egalitarian Court, aligning with his belief in breaking down archaic hierarchies.  

Evan’s demeanor is approachable and self-effacing, often using humor to defuse tension. Beneath his laid-back, nerdy exterior lies a sharp mind and a keen understanding of the Court’s political landscape. He prefers diplomacy and subtle persuasion to brute force, relying on his investigative skills and intellect to navigate Savannah’s intricate social dynamics.  

***Description:***  
Evan has a wiry, athletic build with light tan skin and sharp features that hint at his cunning nature. His short, dark brown hair is slightly unkempt, and he wears rectangular glasses that complement his bright hazel eyes, which are always alert and observing.  

Evan’s wardrobe leans toward the nerdy and practical: button-down shirts with quirky patterns or muted colors, fitted jeans, and sneakers. He often layers with a cardigan or lightweight jacket, blending comfort with an understated sense of style. His look is completed by a simple chain necklace bearing the Carthian sigil, a quiet declaration of his allegiance.
