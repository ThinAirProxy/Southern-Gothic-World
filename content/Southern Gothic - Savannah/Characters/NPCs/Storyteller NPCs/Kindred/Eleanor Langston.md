***Personality:***  
Eleanor Langston exudes confidence, charm, and an air of absolute authority. As a leader, she is calculated and poised, effortlessly commanding both attention and respect. Her words are honeyed but sharp, weaving diplomacy and manipulation into every conversation. Eleanor is fiercely protective of her Family and deeply loyal to the Invictus, viewing her role as both a guardian of tradition and a master strategist for the Court's future.  

Though impeccably polite and graceful, Eleanor’s power extends beyond her words and status. Her Melissidae bloodline grants her a disturbing yet beautiful connection to her hive, which she uses as a reminder of her authority—and a weapon against those who defy her.  

***Description:***  
Eleanor is the epitome of elegance. Her tailored suits and designer dresses are always immaculate, exuding a modern yet timeless sense of style. She favors muted colors—black, ivory, and navy—with subtle golden accents that evoke her connection to her hive. Her honey-blonde hair is styled perfectly, often in an intricate updo resembling the structure of a hive. Her sharp, hazel eyes carry both warmth and warning, hinting at the predator beneath her polished exterior.  

The most unsettling aspect of Eleanor’s appearance is not immediately visible. Nestled inside her body is a living hive of bees, their presence betrayed only by the faint hum that follows her in moments of tension or excitement. Her movements are fluid and graceful, but those who displease her have reported a sudden and inexplicable itch, as if a warning from her swarm.
