***Personality:***  
Marisol Vega exudes the eerie grace and calculated control characteristic of the Erzsebet bloodline. As a Vizier, her intellect and strategic mind make her indispensable to Savannah’s Court. Marisol is deeply pragmatic, using her position to maintain the city’s logistical stability while subtly furthering the Ordo Dracul’s pursuits of transcendence.  

Though outwardly composed and professional, Marisol’s Erzsebet lineage gives her an unsettling edge. She thrives in moments of quiet power, her every action and word carefully calculated to serve her goals. Her dedication to the Ordo Dracul is unwavering, and she views her role in the Court as an opportunity to align Savannah’s future with the Order’s principles.  

***Description:***  
Marisol’s appearance is striking and slightly unnerving. Her golden-brown skin has an unnatural smoothness, and her dark almond-shaped eyes carry a predatory sharpness that makes even her warmest smiles feel calculated. Her long black hair is always impeccably styled, often in loose waves or elaborate updos that emphasize her beauty and control.  

Her wardrobe combines elegance and utility, favoring sleek, tailored dresses and suits in dark jewel tones like emerald and ruby. She accessorizes sparingly but with precision, always wearing a silver dragon-shaped pendant as a nod to her devotion to the Ordo Dracul. Subtle details in her appearance—an unnaturally flawless complexion or an almost imperceptible sheen to her skin—hint at her Erzsebet lineage.
