***Personality:***  
Marcus Devereaux is a disciplined and focused leader, his presence commanding respect and attention. A Vietnam veteran turned Kindred, Marcus’s leadership style reflects his military roots: decisive, pragmatic, and protective. He believes in the strength of preparation and unity, often emphasizing the importance of order and vigilance in the chaotic world of Kindred politics.  

Marcus’s rise to Primogen came at the cost of a strained relationship with [[Isabella SanGiovanni]], whom he challenged and defeated for leadership of the Mekhet. While he values her wisdom and mystical insight, he considers her necromantic practices risky and misaligned with the Mekhet’s goals under his leadership. Despite their differences, he maintains a grudging respect for her, knowing her influence still holds sway within their Clan.  

***Description:***  
Marcus is ruggedly handsome, with light tan skin that gives him a healthy, outdoorsy appearance even in undeath. His middle-aged features exude confidence and authority, framed by a neatly trimmed salt-and-pepper beard and short, practical hair that reflects his disciplined personality. His piercing brown eyes are both warm and intense, hinting at the soldier’s resolve and the strategist’s sharp mind behind them.  

Marcus’s style is functional yet refined. He favors tailored suits during Court gatherings, their clean lines and dark tones lending him a commanding presence. Outside the Court, his attire is more practical—dark tactical clothing suited for his role as a protector and leader. The dog tag from his Vietnam service remains his constant companion, engraved with symbols of the Lancea et Sanctum, a nod to both his mortal past and his current convictions.
