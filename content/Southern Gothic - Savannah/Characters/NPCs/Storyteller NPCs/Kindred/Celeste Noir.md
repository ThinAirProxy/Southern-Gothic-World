***Personality:***  
Celeste Noir is a sharp-tongued and enigmatic Harpy who uses her Asnam bloodline to elevate her influence within the Court of Savannah. Her innate connection to the mystical aspects of the Asnam allows her to weave subtle, unnerving power into her social maneuvers, creating an aura of allure and unease. Celeste thrives on tracking debts, favors, and slights, wielding her knowledge like a weapon to subtly shift the balance of power.  

As a member of the Circle of the Crone, Celeste views social interaction as a sacred ritual, blending spirituality and politics to further her Covenant’s goals. She has an uncanny ability to expose hidden truths and manipulate the emotions of those around her, making her both respected and feared.  

***Description:***  
Celeste is a strikingly beautiful woman with light brown skin that seems to shimmer faintly under certain lighting, a subtle hallmark of her Asnam heritage. Her sleek black hair is often styled into intricate updos or loose waves, enhancing her refined yet slightly otherworldly appearance. Her piercing hazel eyes glimmer with intelligence and danger, capable of captivating and unnerving in equal measure.  

Her attire is always meticulously chosen, favoring modern high-fashion with gothic undertones—long, flowing dresses, lace accents, and silver jewelry adorned with occult symbols. Her presence is magnetic, drawing attention wherever she goes, while her demeanor suggests she knows far more than she reveals.
