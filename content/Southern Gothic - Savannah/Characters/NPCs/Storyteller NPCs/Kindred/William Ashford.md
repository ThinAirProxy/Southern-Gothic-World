***Personality:***  
Prince William Ashford is a paragon of aristocratic charm and unyielding control, though his Nosferatu nature lends a subtle air of menace to his otherwise dignified presence. A calculating and pragmatic ruler, he is deeply protective of Savannah and its traditions, valuing order above all else. Beneath his calm exterior lies the weight of centuries, and the knowledge that his time is running short.  

***Description:***  
Prince Ashfordâ€™s Nosferatu curse manifests as a slight ashen pallor and hollowed features, giving him a spectral appearance. His attire is meticulously tailored, reflecting the style of a bygone era, with subtle nods to his colonial roots. His deep-set, piercing eyes command respect and fear in equal measure, and his movements, though slow and deliberate, carry an aura of authority.
