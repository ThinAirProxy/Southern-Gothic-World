***Personality:***  
Serena Calloway exudes an aura of quiet authority and haunting serenity, a reflection of her role as Keeper of Elysium at **[[Serene Repose]]**, Savannah’s spa Elysium. Her unsettling yet graceful presence ensures the space remains a sanctuary of neutrality and reflection. A devout member of the Lancea et Sanctum and a proud Baddacelli, Serena sees her position as both a duty and a spiritual calling, maintaining Serene Repose as a place where Kindred can find respite and contemplate their Damned existence.  

Serena’s meticulous nature and her ability to detect emotional shifts through sound and vibration make her an effective Keeper. Though her demeanor can be disquieting, her fairness and dedication have earned her respect across the Court.  

***Description:***  
Serena’s Nosferatu curse manifests in her unnervingly thin frame and face obscured by grotesque folds of scarred skin, giving the impression of melted wax. Her milky-white eyes add to her otherworldly presence, while her deliberate movements carry an eerie grace.  

She dresses in flowing dark cloaks and simple, elegant garments in muted colors that shroud her form and add an air of mystique. A rosary of black beads adorned with small, carved skulls hangs around her neck, a subtle nod to her devotion to the Sanctified. Despite her disfigurement, her presence is one of quiet control, and her voice, melodic and soft, carries an almost hypnotic quality.
