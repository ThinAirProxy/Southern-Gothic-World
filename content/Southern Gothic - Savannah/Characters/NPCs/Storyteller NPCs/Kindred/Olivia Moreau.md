Olivia Moreau is an icon of charisma and progressive ideals, blending her uncanny charm with an unwavering belief in the Carthian philosophy. She is a visionary who seeks to challenge the old order of Savannah’s Court, advocating for a more egalitarian society where power is earned through merit, not bloodline or tradition. Her sharp wit and magnetic presence make her a beloved figure among Carthians and a polarizing one among the more conservative factions of the Court.  

Olivia is calculated and strategic, fully aware of the weight her position as Primogen carries. She plays the game of Court politics with precision, using her charm and connections to push her agenda while avoiding overt defiance of the Prince. She is confident in her ability to navigate the delicate balance between her Carthian ideals and the realities of Savannah’s rigid hierarchy.
