***Personality:***  
MeeMaw is a force of nature, a creature of primal instinct and ancient wisdom who cares little for Covenants or their lofty ideals. Her loyalty is to her Family, the Gangrel, and to the wild, untamed world she represents. As a member of the Dead Wolf bloodline, she embodies the fierce independence and spiritual connection to the earth that defines her kind. MeeMaw’s demeanor is soft and disarming, like a kindly grandmother sharing stories by the fire, but this gentleness belies a feral cunning and an unrelenting will. She has survived through grit, adaptability, and the patience of a predator lying in wait.

***Description:***  
MeeMaw appears as a weathered, frail old woman, her dark skin etched with the lines of a long and arduous life. Her white hair is tied into a simple bun or hidden beneath a patterned scarf, and her clothes are plain and practical, often faded house dresses and sturdy boots that reflect her Depression-era roots. She walks with a carved wooden stick, more a symbol of her deep connection to the land than a crutch.  

Despite her seemingly fragile appearance, MeeMaw’s eyes betray her true nature. Bright and sharp, they gleam with a predator’s awareness, always watching, always calculating. Her movements are deliberate, carrying an almost imperceptible grace that speaks to the strength she hides beneath her stooped posture.  

MeeMaw rules her Family from a secluded hunting lodge deep in the wilderness outside Savannah. The lodge and its surrounding lands are a domain of primal energy, a place where the boundaries between predator and prey blur. Here, MeeMaw trains her kin, tests the resolve of newcomers, and offers sanctuary to those she deems worthy. As Primogen of the Gangrel, she holds a seat of immense power within the Court, her voice as steady and unyielding as the land she calls home. Though she has no Covenant affiliations, her wisdom and influence make her a force that none in Savannah can ignore.
