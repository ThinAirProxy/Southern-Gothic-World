***Personality:***  
Iris Hollow is a serene and methodical Deputy whose Galloi bloodline grants her an unsettling allure. Her appearance, unnervingly perfect, is both a blessing and a curse, reflecting her role as both enforcer and spiritual guide. She wields her shockingly beautiful visage like a weapon, using it to disarm and manipulate those who underestimate her. Beneath her ethereal beauty lies a sharp intellect and an unflinching dedication to maintaining order in the Court.  

Iris views her role as sacred, balancing loyalty to the Prince with her spiritual devotion to the Circle of the Crone. She believes justice is a divine act, and her duties are carried out with calm precision, ensuring that harmony is restored wherever chaos threatens.  

***Description:***  
Iris is shockingly beautiful, her face perfectly smooth and symmetrical to an unnatural degree. Her skin glows faintly, as though lit from within, and her features are flawless to the point of being unsettling. Her almond-shaped amber eyes are piercing and otherworldly, drawing attention and unnerving those who meet her gaze for too long.  

Her dark, glossy hair is impeccably styled, often cascading in loose waves or tied back in elegant simplicity. She dresses in dark, flowing garments that enhance her ethereal presence, adorned with subtle symbols of the Crone. Despite her perfection, there is an uncanny, almost doll-like quality to her appearance that leaves even the boldest Kindred uneasy.
