***Personality:***  
Jonathan Hayes exemplifies the Rotgrafen bloodline’s focus on control, manipulation, and meticulous planning. As a self-proclaimed independent elder, he operates outside the confines of Covenants, leveraging his Rotgrafen heritage to maintain a firm grip on his personal empire. His disdain for ideological allegiances is born from a belief that true power lies in self-reliance and unyielding discipline.  

Jonathan is pragmatic to a fault, preferring calculated risks over bold actions. He is a master of subtle influence, often orchestrating outcomes without drawing attention to his role. While his independence has earned him respect among some and suspicion among others, he is careful to maintain his position as a neutral yet potent force within Savannah’s Court.  

***Description:***  
Jonathan is a tall, statuesque man with sharp, symmetrical features that exude confidence and authority. His light tan skin is flawless, and his dark brown hair, always perfectly styled, complements his piercing gray eyes. These eyes seem to weigh and measure everyone he meets, a hallmark of his Rotgrafen lineage.  

His clothing reflects his preference for understated elegance: tailored three-piece suits in muted tones of charcoal, navy, or black. A platinum ring bearing the Rotgrafen sigil adorns his right hand, a subtle acknowledgment of his bloodline. Jonathan’s presence is commanding, his movements precise, and his demeanor cool and deliberate, making him a difficult figure to ignore.
