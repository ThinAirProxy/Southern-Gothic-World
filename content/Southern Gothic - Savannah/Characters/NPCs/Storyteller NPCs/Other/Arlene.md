***Description:***  
Though she stands no taller than a whisper, Arlene has a way of making you feel as if she’s looking down at you—even when you tower over her. Petite in frame, with blonde hair and ice-blue eyes, she turns heads with a face that could belong on a billboard. But those eyes tell a different story. There’s something cold and calculating behind them, something dangerous. The kind of danger that doesn’t posture or bluff. It’s real, and it’s close. Whatever violence Arlene is capable of—and it’s more than most—she doesn’t need to prove it. You already feel it.   

***Personality:***  
At a glance, she could be a beauty queen or someone laughing under the lights at the Crimson Veil, all sparkle and charm. But Arlene has teeth—and she knows how to use them. She doesn’t take shit, doesn’t explain herself, and doesn’t need to raise her voice to get a room to listen. There’s steel in her, coiled tight behind a crooked smile, and though she keeps her temper on a short leash, everyone knows what happens when a werewolf loses control. She’s not here to make nice. She’s here to make sure you know exactly where the line is—and what happens when you cross it. She doesn’t wear her title like a badge, but no one questions it. Arlene is the Alpha—undisputed, unshaken, and without the need to raise her voice.
