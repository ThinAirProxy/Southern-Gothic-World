**Blood Wine **
	Savannah’s Most Exclusive Indulgence 

A staple of **Savannah’s Elysiums and Family Estates**, **Blood Wine** is the city’s answer to the eternal Kindred conundrum—how to enjoy the indulgence of fine drinking when the undead body can only stomach one thing.  

### **What Is Blood Wine?**  
Blood Wine is crafted from the lifeblood of carefully selected **Blood Dolls** across the city. Through a **secretive blood magic ritual**, the blood is preserved, ensuring it never stagnates, curdles, or sours the way stored blood normally does. The result is a **rich, smooth, and palatable drink** that Kindred can savor **without the need to purge it afterward.**  

### **The Trade-Off**  
While Blood Wine is a pleasure to drink, it is entirely empty—it provides **no Vitae**, no sustenance, and does nothing to quell the Hunger. It is pure **decadence**, a luxury for those who crave the sensation of drinking rather than its necessity.  

### **Effects on Different Drinkers**  
**Kindred** – A smooth, pleasant drink, free of the stale, foul taste of stored blood. It carries the faintest whispers of its mortal origins, with **subtle undertones of flavor** depending on the donor.  

**Humans** – Foul. Tastes like a cheap, overly metallic wine, with a strong coppery aftertaste that lingers unpleasantly.  

**Ghouls** – Reactions vary. **Newer ghouls** describe it as bitter and unappetizing, similar to mortal perceptions. **Older ghouls**, however, tend to enjoy it, describing the taste as **deep, warming, and slightly euphoric.** The exact reason remains unknown, but speculation suggests that long-term exposure to Vitae changes how a ghoul perceives **the taste of blood itself.**  

### **Distribution & Exclusivity**  
Blood Wine is **not available to just anyone**. It is distributed discreetly among Savannah’s **Elysiums and major Family Estates**, ensuring that only those with proper standing can partake in its luxury. Those who abuse access or waste the supply may find themselves **cut off**.  

It is a **symbol of status**, a **gesture of hospitality**, and a **reminder that even the Damned can still savor the finer things in life.**  

When next you visit an Elysium and a **dark red glass** is set before you, **drink deeply, savor, and remember:**  

**Some pleasures are meant only for the dead.**
