# **The Process of the Embrace in Savannah**

In the Court of Savannah, the Embrace is not a casual act—it is a sacred and structured process steeped in tradition and respect for the Kindred’s laws. Every Embrace is an opportunity to strengthen the Court and shape the future of the city’s Kindred society. The process is overseen with care and precision, ensuring the balance of power and responsibility is upheld.

## **1. The Introduction**  
The journey begins with the **Introduction**. The prospective childe is brought before the Prince, though often without their knowledge of the Kindred world. Often times the Prospect and the Prince never even directly interact. This introduction often happens in public spaces like a museum viewing, a opera performance, or a fine dinner. This encounter is a test—not only for the prospective fledgling but for the sire as well. The Prince evaluates the prospect’s potential and suitability, weighing their character, background, and potential contribution to the Court. Many candidates never proceed past this stage, as the Prince’s standards are unyielding.

## **2. Ghouling or The Embrace**  
If the Prince grants approval, the sire may choose between two paths: **Ghouling** or **Embrace**.  
- **Ghouling** allows the prospect to serve as a mortal servant, giving the sire time to assess their loyalty and aptitude before committing to the Embrace. Some Prospects are choosen only to be Ghouls and will always remain this way.
- **The Embrace** itself transforms the mortal into one of the Damned, binding them eternally to Kindred society. This act is carried out with ceremony, as the sire imparts both the gift and the curse of immortality.

## **3. House Training**  
Once Embraced, the fledgling enters a period of **House Training**, lasting three to six months, or shorter if they were a Ghoul prior and already underwent this. During this time, the fledgling is sequestered from the wider Court and placed under the tutelage of their sire and Clan. They learn the intricacies of Kindred existence: their abilities, the laws of the Court, and the delicate dance of politics. This period is both a test and a preparation, ensuring the fledgling is ready to navigate the treacherous world they now inhabit. They socialize almost exclusively with members of their Clan, especially other neonates. 

Things your character knows before you are allowed to make your Debut:
 - Court Structure
 - Who holds court titles, names and face
 - Court title roles and responsibilities
 - Brief explanation of Covenants
 - Detailed understanding of your In-Clan Disciplines
 - In-depth understanding of their own capabilities
 - Overview of all Basic Disciplines
 - Names, Faces of Everyone in your clan.
 - Some idea who other Neonates made under the Edict because of Debuts
 - The Traditions
 - Locations of Family Estates and Elysium.
 - How to use the Cacophony and the Nexus
 - How to feed
 - A basic overview of the previous war and reason for the Edict

## **4. The Debut**  
The culmination of this process is **The Debut**. The fledgling is formally presented to the Court in a grand event, where they are introduced as a recognized member of Kindred society. This event is both a celebration and a test—the fledgling’s first opportunity to prove themselves in the eyes of their peers.  

It is likely that neonates who were embraced before another heard of others Debut or went to them, and therefore have some understanding of who each other are even if not formally introduced.

The process of the Embrace in Savannah is not taken lightly. It reflects the weight of immortality and the responsibility that comes with bringing new blood into the Court. Those who are Embraced are expected to live up to the standards of their sire and their Clan, contributing to the strength and stability of Kindred society. It is an honor—and a burden—that shapes the future of the city with every new face.

# **The Debuts of Savannah’s Clans**

When a fledgling completes their House Training, they are presented to the Court in a formal **Debut**. Each Clan has its own unique way of introducing their new member, reflecting their traditions, values, and culture.

---

## **Nosferatu: The Shadow’s Step**  
The Nosferatu Debut is a quiet and unnerving affair. The fledgling is introduced in total silence, emerging from the shadows at the Prince’s signal. This act symbolizes their acceptance of the darkness that defines their Clan. The Nosferatu’s peers often watch intently, evaluating the fledgling’s ability to move unseen and embrace their cursed beauty.  

---

## **Mekhet: The Candlelight Vigil**  
The Mekhet Debut is held in dim lighting, often by candlelight or under the moon. The fledgling is tasked with recounting a secret they have uncovered during their training. This act demonstrates their aptitude for uncovering truths and their willingness to find the secrets of the Court's enemies. The more insightful the secret, the greater their impression on the Clan.  

---

## **Gangrel: The Blood Hunt**  
For the Gangrel, the Debut is a trial of survival. The fledgling is sent into the wilderness or an abandoned part of the city to hunt a target chosen by the Clan. They must return with proof of their success, demonstrating their prowess and connection to the primal instincts of the Beast. This trial is both a rite of passage and a test of their resourcefulness.  

---

## **Ventrue: The Silver Oath**  
The Ventrue Debut is a formal and grand affair. The fledgling is brought before the Court to swear an oath of loyalty to their Clan and the Prince, often reciting lines from a script passed down through generations. The fledgling’s demeanor, poise, and ability to command the room are as much under scrutiny as their words, reflecting the Ventrue’s emphasis on leadership.  

---

## **Daeva: The Velvet Masquerade**  
The Daeva Debut is an extravagant celebration. The fledgling is presented at a lavish party, where they are tasked with mingling and charming the Court. Their ability to dazzle and captivate others is evaluated throughout the evening. This Debut is as much about showcasing the fledgling’s allure as it is about reinforcing the Daeva’s reputation for beauty and sophistication.
