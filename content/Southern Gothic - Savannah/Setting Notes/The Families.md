![[The Families.png]]
In Savannah, power flows through the Families like blood through veins, each one a pillar of the Court, its influence rising and falling with the actions of its Primogen. These Families—what outsiders might call Clans—are more than lineages. They are the foundation of Kindred life in the city, binding their members with shared blood, history, and ambition. Together, they form the heart of the Court’s politics, their Primogens sitting as the most powerful voices of the city, second only to the Prince himself.

The Families have always been the lifeblood of the Court, their presence woven into Savannah’s story as tightly as the roots of her ancient oaks. Each Family claims its place in the city’s tapestry, wielding influence that extends far beyond their own ranks. To belong to a Family in Savannah is to inherit not just a name, but a legacy—a responsibility to uphold the traditions of the Court while carving out a place in its treacherous politics.

At the center of this web of power lies the **Primogen Council**, a body of five, each representing their Family’s interests. These Primogens are not merely figureheads. They are the architects of Savannah’s future, the arbiters of its present, and the keepers of its past. While the Prince holds ultimate authority, the Primogens shape the city in their image, guiding their Families and influencing the decisions that ripple through the Court. Their power is undeniable, but it is not absolute. They must walk a fine line, balancing loyalty to their Prince, devotion to their Family, and the constant threat of ambition from within and without.

The Council’s meetings are events of whispered gravitas and veiled threat, held in shadowed chambers where words are sharper than blades. Decisions are made not through brute force but through the subtle dance of alliances and rivalries, where a raised eyebrow or a pointed silence can shift the balance of power. The Primogens wield their influence like masterful conductors, each move orchestrating a symphony of power that resonates throughout the Court.

But for all their strength, the Families are not without their vulnerabilities. The Primogens know that their position is precarious, their authority built on the loyalty of their kin and the Prince’s favor. Should a Family falter—whether from internal strife, a failed alliance, or the ambitions of a rival—the consequences would ripple through the Court, leaving the balance of power teetering dangerously close to collapse. It is this fragility, this ever-present tension, that makes the Families of Savannah both the city’s greatest strength and its most profound weakness.

The Families are the heartbeat of the Court. They are the keepers of Savannah’s traditions, the guardians of its future, and the players in a game as old as Kindred themselves. To rise in this city is to understand the Families, to navigate their labyrinthine politics, and to recognize that in Savannah, every favor granted and every alliance founded is written in blood.
