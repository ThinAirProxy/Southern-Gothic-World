# **Belial’s Brood ** 
	The Forsaken Scourge

Savannah’s Kindred know better than to dismiss whispers in the dark. And when those whispers speak of **Belial’s Brood**, they carry the weight of blood and fire.  

## **What Every Kindred Knows**  
Belial’s Brood—often just called **The Brood**—are **vampires who reject The Traditions**, forsaking everything that binds the Damned together. They are **monsters in the truest sense**, reveling in destruction, chaos, and their **worship of darkness itself.**  

They do not cling to **humanity** or struggle against **the Beast**. They **embrace it freely**, welcoming their descent into something worse than mere predators.  

- They **do not fear the Hunger**—they become it.  
- They **do not seek power within the Court**—they seek to **tear it down.**  
- They **do not suffer the Masquerade**—they believe in **bringing Hell to Earth.**  

### **The Blood Magics of the Brood**  
The Brood wield **blood sorcery that no other Kindred has been able to replicate.** Some claim it is infernal in nature, tied to the **demonic forces they revere**, while others insist it is a **lost discipline, warped through madness and blood sacrifice.**  

What is known is this: **it is real, it is powerful, and it is not understood.**  

### **The War on Savannah**  
Savannah learned **firsthand** what it means to be in the sights of Belial’s Brood.  

In **2023**, the Brood launched a **coordinated attack on the city**, striking against **Elysiums, Family Estates, and even Kindred Havens**. The **Court nearly collapsed**, with **elders and neonates alike meeting Final Death.**  

It was a war fought **in the streets, in the shadows, and in the very minds of Kindred who dared to resist.** And though the Brood was **driven out**, it was a **pyrrhic victory**. The price was **steep**, and the wounds **still linger**.  

### **The Brood in Atlanta**  
Now, the **whispers have returned**.  

Reports say that **Belial’s Brood has begun resurfacing in Atlanta.** They are **gathering**, rebuilding their numbers, and preparing for something. **No one knows what.**  

Are they returning to **Savannah**? Are they plotting something **even worse**?  

What is certain is that **they have not forgotten this city.** And if history has taught anything, it is that the Brood **never lets a grudge die.**  

**Stay vigilant. Stay wary. The war may not be over.**
