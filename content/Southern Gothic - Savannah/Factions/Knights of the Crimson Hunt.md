### **The Knights of the Crimson Hunt**  
*A Shadowed Oath in Blood and Steel*  

In the dark corners of Savannah’s underbelly, where whispers travel faster than sound, a new force has begun to stir. They do not bow before the Prince’s throne, nor swear allegiance to any Clan or Covenant. They exist outside the old laws and traditions, yet claim to serve a singular cause: **the survival of the Domain.**  

No one knows who first uttered the name *Knights of the Crimson Hunt*, but the rumors are impossible to ignore. The secretive order moves with purpose, seeking out the most militant among Savannah’s Kindred—enforcers, warriors, strategists, and even Ghouls with the skill and will to fight. Their recruitment is quiet but calculated, reaching those who are dissatisfied with the endless political maneuvering of the Court, those who believe **inaction is the true betrayal.**
### **A Cause Shrouded in Secrecy**  
The *Knights* do not seek to rule. They do not play at Primogen politics or crave Elysium’s favor. Their singular purpose is clear:  

- **Repel the coming invasion.**  
- **Hunt and destroy Belial’s Brood within Savannah.**  
- **Protect the Kindred of the city, even from themselves.**  

They claim that the Court is too fractured to act decisively, that Savannah’s Kindred are too wrapped in their own agendas to see the greater threat looming at their borders. *The Knights of the Crimson Hunt* see themselves as a necessary response—a force willing to do what must be done while others squabble over titles and power plays.
### **The Shattered Blade**  
At the heart of their philosophy lies *The Shattered Blade*, a symbol rather than a relic. It represents the five Clans, broken apart by their own divisions and ambitions. But the blood that binds the shards together serves as a reminder: **they are all Kindred. They must stand as one if they are to survive.**
# **Doctrine of the Hunt**  
The Knights adhere to a strict doctrine that governs their actions:  

1. **Secrecy Above All** – The Knights are, by their very nature, traitors to the established order. To be discovered is to invite destruction. A Knight must never reveal their allegiance nor that of their brethren.  

2. **Loyalty to One Another** – A Knight never stands alone. When a call for aid is made, it must be answered. The Brood is a force of overwhelming horror; only through unity can they be opposed.  

3. **The Eternal Hunt** – The Brood is relentless, and so too must be the Knights. They must seek, watch, and prepare for battle at all times. Their war does not pause for politics.  

4. **Savannah Must Endure** – Though they act beyond the bounds of Court, they still serve its unknowing interests. No action must ever weaken or endanger the Domain itself. This is the highest law of the Crimson Hunt.
# **The Court’s Response**  
For now, *Prince William Ashford* and his *Sheriff, Malcolm Grayson*, have not officially condemned the *Knights of the Crimson Hunt*, but their disapproval is evident. The Prince has stated:  

*"Kindred who join the Knights may not always find themselves in good standing with the Court."*  

It is a carefully veiled warning. The Prince does not need to hunt them—not yet. But those who stand outside his rule will find little protection should their secrets come to light.  

The *Sheriff* has been less diplomatic, calling the Knights *"a liability waiting to happen."* He argues that those who take justice into their own hands will one day see themselves above all law, and in that moment, they will become just as much of a threat as the monsters they claim to fight.
### **A War in the Shadows**  
Regardless of the Court’s disapproval, the *Knights of the Crimson Hunt* continue their silent work. Their numbers are growing. Their weapons are being sharpened. And when the time comes, when the Brood makes its move, the only question that will remain is this:  

**Will Savannah be saved by its hidden protectors… or will it burn with them?**
